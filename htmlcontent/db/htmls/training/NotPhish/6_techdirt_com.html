<p>When someone asks me what DRM is, my answer is very simple: it’s anti-piracy software that generally doesn’t stop pirates at all, and, instead, mostly only <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/01/20/diablo-2-resurrection-includes-30-day-online-check-reasons-nobody-can-figure-out/">annoys</a> legitimate buyers. Well, then why do software and video game companies use it at all? Couldn’t tell you. Businesses really want to annoy their own <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/11/drm-breaking-games-again-this-time-due-to-new-intel-chip-architecture/">customers</a>? Apparently, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/11/10/denuvo-games-once-again-broken-paying-customers-thanks-to-drm-mishap/">yes</a>. Timothy, when you say this doesn’t really stop pirates, you’re exaggerating, right? No, not at all.</p>
<p>The worst of the examples of legit customers getting screwed by video game DRM involve when a game or product is bricked simply because a publisher or its DRM partner simply <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/07/06/drm-strikes-again-ubisoft-makes-own-game-unplayable-shutting-down-drm-server/">shuts down</a> the servers that make the DRM work, on purpose or otherwise.</p>
<p><em>Gran Turismo 7</em> was recently released on the PlayStation and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/gt7-gran-turismo-7-metacritic-review-bomb-offline-sony-1848680758">already facing major headwinds</a> due to the public’s absolute hate for all the microtransactions included in the game. On top of that, the entire game, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/server-issues-lock-gran-turismo-7-owners-out-of-single-player-races/">including the single player content</a>, was rendered unplayable because the DRM servers that require an online check to play the game crumbled during a maintenance window.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The scheduled server maintenance, timed around the release of the version 1.07 patch for the game, was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/03/16/gran-turismo-7-update-gt7-maintenance-time/">initially planned</a>&nbsp;to last just two hours starting at 6 am GMT (2 am Eastern) on Thursday morning. Six hours later, though, the official&nbsp;Gran Turismo&nbsp;Twitter account&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/thegranturismo/status/1504435541038833665">announced</a>&nbsp;that “due to an issue found in Update 1.07, we will be extending the Server Maintenance period. We will notify everyone as soon as possible when this is likely to be completed. We apologize for this inconvenience and ask for your patience while we work to resolve the issue.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Inconvenience” in this case means not being able to play the game the customer purchased. Like, basically at all. Why the single player content in a console game of all things should require an online check-in is completely beyond me. Console piracy is a thing, but certainly not <em>much</em> of a thing. There is zero chance that this DRM is worth the headache Sony now has on its hands.</p>
<p>A headache that lasted for more than a full calendar day, by the way. And a headache that Sony’s competitors picked up on to use in messaging to the public on social media.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>For now,&nbsp;Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;owners tired of waiting to play the game they bought are forced to look elsewhere for their racing fix. As EA and Codemasters have&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/gridgame/status/1504783690735497240">cheekily tweeted</a>,&nbsp;Grid Legends&nbsp;“is a videogame with cars in it that you can play right now.” Imagine that!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine that.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe">I can’t breathe.</a>“</p>
<p>Those are words universally recognized as an expression of respiratory distress.</p>
<p>Unless you’re a cop.</p>
<p>Then they’re perceived as, at best, non-compliance. At worst, they’re perceived as active resistance. </p>
<p>“I can’t breathe,” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe#Others" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_can't_breathe#Others">many people have told the officers</a> currently choking the life out of them. In most documented cases, these people have ended up dead. Law enforcement refuses to see the connection between these cries for help and the corpses they created, ranging from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/12/nypd-officer-chokes-man-to-death-cops-blame-cellphone-recordings-people-feeling-they-have-more-rights/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2014/08/12/nypd-officer-chokes-man-to-death-cops-blame-cellphone-recordings-people-feeling-they-have-more-rights/">Eric Garner’s killing</a> by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/21/filming-cops-is-best-accountability-tool-officer-derek-chauvin-convicted-murder-killing-george-floyd/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/04/21/filming-cops-is-best-accountability-tool-officer-derek-chauvin-convicted-murder-killing-george-floyd/">George Floyd’s murder</a> by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.</p>
<p>And they have refused to accept any responsibility for the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200601/08223344619/let-motherfucker-burn.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200601/08223344619/let-motherfucker-burn.shtml">protests and riots</a> their actions have touched off for decades, preferring to accuse the public of being incapable of understanding the nuances of excessive force deployment or complaining that doing their jobs lawfully is just too difficult.</p>
<p>So it’s unsurprising we have more of the same to contend with. This killing occurred two months <em>before</em> George Floyd’s murder but is only coming to light now because the victim’s family has managed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/edward-bronstein-california-highway-patrol-death.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/17/us/edward-bronstein-california-highway-patrol-death.html">force the recording out of the hands of the people who killed their loved one</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Mr. Bronstein was driving in Burbank around 1 a.m. on March 31, 2020, when he was pulled over, Mr. Carrillo said. He was about five minutes from the house in Burbank where he lived with his father, Ms. Palomino said.</em></p>
<p><em>The officers gave him a breathalyzer test, which showed that he was under the legal limit, but they suspected that he was under the influence of a narcotic and obtained a warrant to draw his blood, according to a police report.</em></p>
<p><em>They placed him in handcuffs and brought him to the station parking lot near Pasadena. The video, which was filmed by a police officer using what appeared to be a hand-held camera, showed Mr. Bronstein kneeling before the officers, his arms behind his back.</em></p>
<p><em>“This is wrong,” Mr. Bronstein said.</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re bringing the fight to this, not us,” an officer told him.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m not fighting at all,” he responded.</em></p>
<p><em>The officer told him to take a seat and provide his arm.</em></p>
<p><em>“This is your last opportunity,” the officer said. “Otherwise you’re going face down on the mat and we’re going to keep on going.”</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Bronstein sighed and then said, “I just need a minute, OK, please?”</em></p>
<p><em>His face crumpled.</em></p>
<p><em>“I can’t do it,” he said, and then quickly added, “I’ll do it willingly.”</em></p>
<p><em>But by that point, the officers had grabbed him and forced him down on the mat.</em></p>
<p><em>“Please don’t,” Mr. Bronstein said, repeating over and over again that he would cooperate.</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s too late,” one of the officers said. For nearly two minutes, Mr. Bronstein screamed and gasped, telling the officers at least a dozen times, “I can’t breathe.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybWJe6G5guc" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybWJe6G5guc">can be seen here</a>. Content warning: contains murder.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ybWJe6G5guc" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The video shows Bronstein was unresponsive as early as four minutes into the recording. It goes on for another <em>14 minutes</em> after that as officers check his pulse, slap him in the face, and otherwise make it appear they haven’t just killed someone. It’s not until nearly the end of the recording — a full ten minutes after Bronstein stops moving — that officers attempt to give the man oxygen, shortly before deciding it’s too late for that and begin CPR.</p>
<p>No officers were disciplined for this. It was not captured on their dashcams, which might have led to this incident coming to light earlier. It was apparently captured by a camera (or cell phone) operated by someone present. The lawyer for the family speculates it may have been recorded for training purposes. </p>
<p>If so, no one’s learning anything from it yet, other than it is possible to obtain recordings not captured on on-board equipment through discovery. From what’s been reported, no officers were disciplined and the recording was filed away someplace the California Highway Patrol thought no one would ever find it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/us/california-edward-bronstein-police-custody-death-video/index.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/17/us/california-edward-bronstein-police-custody-death-video/index.html">The coroner proved useful as well, </a>aligning the cause of death with the official narrative. (To be fair, the coroner would have had no access to the recording and would have to rely solely on reports created by officers as to the events leading up to Bronstein’s death.)</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office later determined Bronstein died from “acute methamphetamine intoxication during restraint by law enforcement.” It listed the manner of death as “undetermined.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this might be revised now that it’s clear there were at least six uniformed contributing factors. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office says it’s “reviewing the case,” which doesn’t exactly sound like an investigation. And, to be fair to the DA’s office, it’s not as though CHP officials approached them after the incident occurred to see if criminal charges might be warranted.</p>
<p>It’s another senseless killing and another one committed by officers who refuse to believe anyone is truly compliant until they’re “unresponsive.” And it’s one more data point showing that being asphyxiated is about the only guaranteed outcome when officers are informed by the person they’re choking the life out of that they can’t breathe.</p>

A new&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1113" target="_blank">press release</a>&nbsp;about the last of these contains the following section:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>the Data Act reviews certain aspects of the Database Directive, which was created in the 1990s to protect investments in the structured presentation of data. Notably, it clarifies that databases containing data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and objects should not be subject to separate legal protection. This will ensure they can be accessed and used.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Database Directive</a>&nbsp;mentioned there grants copyright protection to databases that “by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author’s own intellectual creation”. It’s a typical attempt to widen the scope of copyright to something that has only the most tenuous kind of “creativity” involved. It was brought in because copyright maximalists believe you can’t have too much copyright, and politicians are too lazy to argue.</p>
<p>Unusually, though, the EU agreed to do something that is never done: to review whether extending copyright actually brings any benefits. Ten years after the Database Directive was passed,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061013211834/https://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/copyright/docs/databases/evaluation_report_en.pdf" target="_blank">an evaluation was published in 2005</a>. It aims were as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>the evaluation focused on whether the European database industry’s rate of growth increased after the <em>introduction of the new right; whether the beneficiaries of the new right produced more databases than they would have produced in the absence of this right; and whether the scope of the right was drafted in a way that targets those areas where Europe needs to encourage innovation.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is what the European Commission’s own evaluation found:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The economic impact of the “sui generis” right on database production is unproven. Introduced to stimulate the production of databases in Europe, the new instrument has had no proven impact on the production of databases.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The report also wrote that the “empirical evidence, at this stage, casts doubts” on the need for a special copyright for a thriving database industry. So you might think that the obvious, rational thing to do would be to repeal an ineffectual, unneeded monopoly. Instead, the report noted that repealing the directive “would probably lead to considerable resistance by the EU database industry.” In other words, purely because the copyright industry would whine about it, the European Commission’s report recommended leaving in place a law that by its own research was shown to be pointless.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of the copyright ratchet: the fact that copyright always gets longer, stronger, and broader, and that once passed, copyright laws are never weakened or repealed. It’s one of the reasons why copyright is such a disaster today. Its laws were framed for the analogue world, and the copyright industry refuses to countenance updating them to make them fit for the digital world. Indeed, as the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://walledculture.org/the-copyright-industry-wants-everything-filtered-as-it-is-uploaded-heres-why-that-will-be-a-disaster/" target="_blank">upload filters</a>&nbsp;in the EU’s horribly-misnamed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_on_Copyright_in_the_Digital_Single_Market" target="_blank">Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market</a>&nbsp;show, new laws are actively making things worse.</p>

<p>We just wrote about Senators Leahy and Tillis and their <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/21/senators-leahy-tillis-to-team-up-to-suggest-destroying-the-internet-for-hollywoods-sake/">“SMART Copyright Act”</a> and its dangerously problematic setup, that would enable Hollywood to petition the Copyright Office to get what it has long desired: mandatory upload filters for websites hosting 3rd party content. Professor Eric Goldman has explained how this bill is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2022/03/wouldnt-it-be-great-if-internet-services-had-to-license-technologies-selected-by-hollywood-comments-on-the-very-dumb-smart-copyright-act.htm" target="_blank">“a thinly veiled proxy war over mandatory filtering”</a> while the EFF has called the bill <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/new-filter-mandate-bill-unmitigated-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“an unmitigated disaster.”</a></p>
<p>But, as I noted in my initial post on it, Tillis released an incredibly disingenuous <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21498034/20220316-sjc-ip-tt-pl-smart-copyright-act_-myth-v-fact-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Myths v. Facts”</a> document in support of the bill. It’s not worth going bit by bit through everything that’s backwards in the document, but in my post I called out one thing that seemed particularly egregious. Tillis suggested that Creative Commons supported his bill.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><strong><em>MYTH: This is a filtering mandate that will chill free speech and harm users.</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>FACT:</strong>&nbsp;The SMART Copyright Act creates an open process for all stakeholders, including the public, to identify copyright-related technological measures that should be broadly available to all. Some measures, like the International Press Telecommunications Council (IPTC) photo metadata standard, <strong>or a Creative Commons license</strong>, can help users know whether and how they can use content while also respecting creators’ rights.&nbsp;Other technological measures, including “filtering” technologies, are used to stop infringing content at scale, or make content available for licensing.&nbsp;The bill ensures that any designation of existing measures requires input from all stakeholders and assessment of public interest considerations. This process is also an opportunity for users to provide technological solutions to these concerns. The Copyright Office’s particular expertise in the area of copyright and its exceptions—like fair use—can assist with ensuring the right balance is struck between curbing infringement that undermines authors’ constitutional rights and promoting online availability of materials.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I noted in my original post that it was pretty despicable to suggest that Creative Commons would support this bill, as they had chosen not to weigh in during the recent discussion regarding these technical measures at the Copyright Office.</p>
<p>Well, now Creative Commons has weighed in… and they <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2022/03/22/cc-opposes-mandatory-copyright-filters-as-well-as-using-cc-to-justify-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t seem particularly happy with Tillis for either this bill, or using the Creative Commons name</a> in pushing propaganda about the bill.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>But one part of this attempt stands out to us: the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/services/files/BBDBFA87-17CA-4D15-AA0F-9B54BFEEA31D">list of “myths”</a>&nbsp;Sen. Tillis released to accompany the bill. In particular, Tillis lists the concern that it is a “filtering mandate that will chill free speech and harm users” as a myth&nbsp;instead of a true danger&nbsp;to free expression–and he cites the existence of CC’s metadata as support for his position.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Creative Commons is&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/2017/02/22/copyright-filtering-mechanisms-dont-cant-respect-fair-use/">strongly opposed to mandatory content filtering measures</a>. And we particularly object to having our work and our name used to imply support for a measure that undermines free expression which CC seeks to protect.</em></p>
<p><em>CC licensing is designed to&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/about/">let creators choose to share their work</a>&nbsp;beyond what copyright allows by default–to grant more permissions, not impose more restrictions. And while our license metadata does let reusers know critical information about licensed rights, this metadata exists to convey important information about licensed works, not to restrict their use. Critically, CC licenses were never designed or intended to override the limitations and exceptions to copyright that allow for free expression.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tillis and whatever staffer came up with this nonsense <em>should</em> feel shame about this. But they won’t. It seems very likely that this was done on purpose, with Tillis’ staffer laughing about using CC’s name in support of Hollywood’s filtering. That alone should disqualify the bill from getting any kind of serious consideration. This bill was deliberately designed to poke at supporters of an open internet and open communications, not as a legitimate entry into the discourse about improving copyright law.</p>
<p>Rather than learning their lesson from the recent 10 year SOPA anniversary, it appears that Senators Leahy and TIllis have decided that enough time has passed to try again…</p>

<p>Well, our inaugural Techdirt Legal Misunderstanding March Madness is off to quite a start. Round one ended with most of the matchups getting thousands of votes, so now we’re on to round two. You can still <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJ5-dGMTYRGqLGXzVgfTitjxmKm_WcRldea8Lqjwm64/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">see the official bracket</a> to see how it matches up with your own personal bracket.</p>

<p>By far the biggest vote getter was the 1st Amendment against the Rules of Evidence, which ended up with just under 5,000 votes. The 1st Amendment won easily, though quite a few lawyers insisted this was the wrong result.</p>

<p>We had several <em>extremely close</em> battles including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506341764969291777" target="_blank">Logan Act (51%) over State Action Doctrine (49%)</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506357423610630146" target="_blank">Citizens United (51.6%) over Copyright (48.4%)</a>, but the closest one was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506357544209424385" target="_blank">ERISA (50.3%) over Joint &amp; Several (49.7%)</a>. Those two bounced back and forth a lot, and at moments were tied 50% each!</p>

<p>The biggest upsets, according to our careful seeding were <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506327445519028227" target="_blank">Entrapment (#14) winning over DMCA (#3)</a> (and winning easily) and the <a href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506342411647086594">14th Amendment (#14) winning over the Affordable Care Act (#3)</a>. For me, the biggest surprise was the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506327333287829506" target="_blank">GDPR losing out to Trademark law</a>. I wasn’t expecting that at all!</p>
<p>Also, I will note that many people were upset about various legal concepts that were left off, or the seeding. I’ll note that immigrations lawyers were particularly perturbed about all of immigration law being lumped into a single category and then seeded 16th (and put up against HIPAA). They tried to rally support, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1506341502502330371" target="_blank">HIPAA still won easily</a>. Perhaps next year we’ll have a bit more on the immigration front…</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1507039644432535553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round two has now begun</a>, so make sure to get in your votes. It will run through Friday morning…</p>
<h2 class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://twitter.com/techdirt/status/1507039644432535553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go Vote In Round Two!</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration">Formed less than a month</a> after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, the TSA has yet to get a firm grip on “transportation security,” the thing that makes up two-thirds of its acronym. <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/11/15/tis-season-to-fail-to-catch-contraband-explosive-devices-tsa-checkpoints/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/11/15/tis-season-to-fail-to-catch-contraband-explosive-devices-tsa-checkpoints/">Audit after audit</a> has found TSA screeners are <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/07/12/taking-s-out-tsa-minneapolis-screeners-fail-to-detect-contraband-94-time/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/07/12/taking-s-out-tsa-minneapolis-screeners-fail-to-detect-contraband-94-time/">incapable of finding explosives</a> and other dangerous contraband. If auditors can rack up a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150602/05474131176/study-tsas-security-theater-troupes-missed-95-smuggled-weapons-explosives.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150602/05474131176/study-tsas-security-theater-troupes-missed-95-smuggled-weapons-explosives.shtml">90-95% success rate</a> smuggling in explosives, no doubt terrorists can do it, too.</p>
<p>But terrorists haven’t. Why? Because terrorists have better options than hijacking planes, something the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/10/21/accidentally-revealed-document-shows-tsa-doesnt-think-terrorists-are-plotting-to-attack-airplanes/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/10/21/accidentally-revealed-document-shows-tsa-doesnt-think-terrorists-are-plotting-to-attack-airplanes/">TSA admitted years ago</a> but somehow still feels justifies it hoovering up billions in funding every year. The “successes” the TSA tends to tout are its ability to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/01/22/dea-tsa-sued-stealing-79-year-old-mans-life-savings-his-daughter-airport/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/01/22/dea-tsa-sued-stealing-79-year-old-mans-life-savings-his-daughter-airport/">fully participate</a> in asset forfeiture programs and sniff out <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2012/01/10/tsa-posts-its-top-good-catches-2011-list-not-one-which-is-actual-terrorist/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2012/01/10/tsa-posts-its-top-good-catches-2011-list-not-one-which-is-actual-terrorist/">novelty “weapons”</a> carried by passengers with no terroristic plans or desires.</p>
<p>The TSA doesn’t just handle planes. It also handles other forms of mass transit, including trains and buses. And it’s similarly disinterested in security when handling those vehicles. Most of its time is wasted the same way it’s wasted at airports: looking for cash or things that aren’t actually contraband. </p>
<p>What you may not know is the TSA is also in charge of overseeing the many gas pipelines that cross the nation. True, pipelines do transport stuff, but not the kind of stuff that can be handled in the “fondle your genitals” <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2010/11/19/tsa-likely-to-face-multiple-sexual-assault-charges-new-searches/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2010/11/19/tsa-likely-to-face-multiple-sexual-assault-charges-new-searches/">sort of way</a> TSA agents are used to. The threat to pipelines has mostly been theoretical, which has largely allowed the TSA to do this job without having its failures detailed by journalists and activists. </p>
<p>Since the threat has mostly been theoretical, the TSA has been able to coast along for several years without having its competency questioned or challenged. Unfortunately for the TSA, the threat went from “theoretical” to “incipient” to “underway” when the Colonial Pipeline (which supplies gas to much of the southeast United States) <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/16/fbis-recovery-colonial-pipeline-bitcoin-ransom-highlights-how-ban-crypto-to-stop-ransomware-cries-were-wrong-again/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/16/fbis-recovery-colonial-pipeline-bitcoin-ransom-highlights-how-ban-crypto-to-stop-ransomware-cries-were-wrong-again/">was hit with ransomware</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack">resulting in shutdowns and gas shortages</a>.</p>
<p>Rather than place the cybersecurity of the pipeline (given the hackers had no genitals to be fondled) in the hands of an actual cybersecurity entity (of which the federal government has several), this security job was handed to the least qualified candidate. As Eric Geller reports for Politico<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/17/tsa-has-screwed-this-up-pipeline-cyber-rules-hitting-major-hurdles-00017893" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/17/tsa-has-screwed-this-up-pipeline-cyber-rules-hitting-major-hurdles-00017893">, the TSA has approached this new job with the same level of competence it’s approached everything else</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Oil and gas pipeline operators say&nbsp;the TSA’s cyber regulations&nbsp;are full of unwieldy or baffling requirements that could actually jeopardize pipeline safety and fuel supplies. Others in the energy sector, and cyber experts who help defend these systems, agree with these objections and say the TSA’s small cyber team has been overwhelmed by a flood of industry requests for workarounds.</em></p>
<p><em>“In every sense, TSA has screwed this up,” said Robert M. Lee, the CEO of Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that works with critical infrastructure companies. “It is a giant cluster and in many ways is a perfect example of what not to do with a regulatory process.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, to be fair, the TSA was incredibly ill-equipped to handle this new directive. Given the heightened threat of Russian cyberattacks following the Russian government’s regular attacks of Ukraine, some agency was going to be saddled with securing pipelines and it sort of made sense to hand it off the entity allegedly handling the <em>physical</em> security of the pipelines.</p>
<p>But the TSA is not only under-equipped to handle this new directive, it has apparently done little to make it better equipped. While TSA officials are currently working with industry reps to iron out the OOPS! ALL WRINKLES rollout of the agency’s apparently copy-pasted security “plan,” the agency apparently only has one official and a handful of part-timers handling questions and applications from pipeline companies attempting to comply with the TSA’s carelessly assembled mandates.</p>
<p>The mandates handed down by the TSA’s cybersecurity team appear to be direct copies of mandates applied to the tech handling the government’s clerical work, rather than the specialized computers and systems that actually control gas pipelines. </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>In July, the TSA issued rules&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/july-2021-tsa-pipeline-security-directive/33a019c5-d074-414a-993a-226ef7703962/" target="_blank">requiring companies to deploy</a>&nbsp;more than three dozen common cybersecurity defenses, including weekly antivirus scans, prompt security patching, strict firewalls to block malware and adoption of multifactor authentication, a technology that asks users for a second proof of identity in addition to a password, in order to block unauthorized access.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can’t just apply office software fixes to hardware running on specialized, often proprietary software. The patching demanded by the TSA’s copy-pasted mandates meant companies would need to send people to each physical control box and attempt to do whatever roughly aligned with the TSA directive to comply. And months after this first directive went out, operators are still struggling to carry out the TSA’s mandates.</p>
<p>The TSA has, at least, admitted it has screwed up this cybersecurity rollout. But apologies aren’t going to make pipelines more secure. Counterproductive efforts like these are actually making it more difficult to secure pipelines from cyberattacks. Gas production and transportation are heavily regulated industries and the to-do list for companies is often topped by federal compliance demands. An inadequate, thoroughly inapplicable set of regulatory demands means companies first have to find something that works that is still compliant and then wait around for the TSA’s understaffed pipeline cybersecurity office to institute changes that better reflect the hardware and software being used by oil companies.</p>
<p>Companies want outcome-based targets that allow them to institute fixes that address the end goals without being tied to ridiculous demands like, I don’t know, purchasing the full version of Norton Antivirus. Given what “help” it’s been so far, it makes far more sense for those handling the equipment to figure out how to best secure the equipment. If the TSA wants to blunder in later to spot check things, then I guess it will give those employees something to do that won’t involve separating people from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/11/07/tsa-security-theater-makes-unwilling-co-star-out-3-year-old-with-rare-medical-condition/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/11/07/tsa-security-theater-makes-unwilling-co-star-out-3-year-old-with-rare-medical-condition/">their medical equipment and/or constitutional rights. </a></p>

</div>
<p>For literally <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/02/17/satellite_tv_hacking/">more than a decade</a> researchers have been warning that global satellite telecommunications networks were vulnerable to all manner of attacks. These attacks vary in nature but allow an intruder miles away to both intercept and disrupt satellite communications. In 2020 hackers again clearly demonstrated how these perpetually unresolved vulnerabilities were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/08/insecure-satellite-internet-is-threatening-ship-and-plane-safety/">putting millions of people at risk</a>. </p>
<p>Fast forward to 2022 and a major hack of Viasat’s satellite systems has caused, you guessed it, massive problems <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/viasat-internet-hack-ukraine-russia/">for an estimated 27,000 users</a>. The attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT satellite system, suspected to be the work of the Russian government, appears to have been intended to disrupt Ukraine communications in the lead up to war, but managed to impact a very large chunk of Europe:</p>
<p>Viasat told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exclusive-us-spy-agency-probes-sabotage-satellite-internet-during-russian-2022-03-11/">Reuters</a> that the cyberattack Viasat says was made possible courtesy of a misconfiguration in a “management section” of its network. The impact was severe enough that many users of the satellite in Germany, the UK, France, the Czech Republic, and elsewhere found that their modems had effectively been bricked and “<a href="https://bigblu.co.uk/service-update/">rendered unusable</a>.” </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Thousands still remain offline across Europe—around 2,000 wind turbines are still disconnected in Germany—and companies are racing to replace broken modems or fix connections with updates. Multiple intelligence agencies, including those in the US and Europe, are also investigating the attack. The Viasat hack is arguably the largest publicly known cyberattack to take place since Russia invaded Ukraine, and it stands out for its impact beyond Ukraine’s borders. But questions about the details of the attack, its purpose, and who carried it out remain—although experts have their suspicions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such spillover impact is routine in such attacks. The attack not only impacted basic broadband connectivity, 5,800 wind turbines in Germany were knocked offline, preventing them from being reset remotely should problems develop.</p>
<p>Again, this could have been avoided if companies had heeded researchers and white-hat hacker warnings. But instead, the dominant paradigm tends to be to try and silence those researchers, or misdirect our attention toward security and privacy issues that grab easy headlines, but are less of a direct threat (see: the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/11/12/trumpland-apparently-just-forgot-about-manufactured-tiktok-hysteria/">two year long Trump-era freak out about TikTok</a>). </p>
<p>Vulnerabilities such as the ones in satellite networks, or the massive, obvious security and privacy problems in the “internet of broken things” sector, tend to be downplayed and ignored because they’re “boring” for the press and politicians. As a result, there’s little incentive to do better. Wash, rinse, and repeat. </p><p></p>

<p>We’ve been making the point for years that the way copyright is currently enforced in online platforms is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/search-g.php?q=dmca+fraud">wide open</a> for abuse and error. Between all the collateral damage created by automated copyright bots and all of the chicanery used to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150904/16030832168/bogus-security-company-cant-take-criticism-issues-bogus-dmca-takedowns-creates-sockpuppet-accounts.shtml">silence critics</a> or to baselessly <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200707/14355744861/what-shock-scammers-are-abusing-youtubes-notice-takedown-system-with-dmca-claims.shtml">collect revenue</a> on the work of others, there is simply more of this nonsense going on than most people realize.</p>
<p>The issue was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/tg01q1/its_time_to_say_goodbye_to_all_the_sunset_tracks/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=embed&amp;utm_content=body&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=01db0b135baa469eb39fe1f731c5bfc2&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=tg01q1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first raised in this Reddit thread</a>&nbsp;last week, when it was noticed that the work of a number of prominent&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>“music archivists” was being removed. This is a&nbsp;particular sore point for the community,&nbsp;since their channels were helping preserve the soundtracks to pieces of content—from both&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>games—that were no longer available in the games themselves.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>But sometimes this sort of thing happens involving a wildly popular good or service, allowing us to highlight for the larger public how big a problem this all is. In this case, we’re talking about how the Destiny community is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-youtube-copyright-takedown-affiliate-c-1848678292">slammed with copyright takedowns</a> on YouTube videos.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Things escalated from there over the next few days, with more and more soundtrack videos removed from the channels of more and more community members and creators. Then the takedowns even began extending to clips people had uploaded of cutscenes from the game that merely had pieces of the soundtrack playing in the background.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, a bunch of fans of <em>Destiny</em> looking to preserve now-gone music from the games are finding their videos gone and their accounts facing copyright strikes. It won’t surprise you to learn both that the community was quite pissed off by all of this and immediately started pointing at Bungie and CSC, a Bungie affiliate. But when the noise got loud enough, well, things got strange.</p>

<p>Yeah, that’s Bungie saying not only is it not the one getting all this content taken down, but even <em>its</em> channels were getting hit. Now, as others have already pointed out, you may notice the careful wording of that tweet. That word “request” is doing a lot of work, as it leaves open the door for this to be some automated system that Bungie chose to employ.</p>
<p>So, while we don’t know yet if this is in the automated system collateral damage category, or the fraudulent copyright takedown category, we do know that there is a problem with how this is all working. And, yet, you can be assured that is unlikely anything substantive will be done about it.</p>

</div>
<p>A Glendale (AZ) police officer (now former police officer… more on that in a bit) isn’t going to be able to walk away from a civil rights lawsuit stemming from excessive force he deployed during a routine traffic stop. An Arizona federal court says there’s enough in dispute that Officer Matt Schneider will have to continue to face the lawsuit filed against him by Johnny Wheatcroft, the vehicle passenger he tased eleven times, including one shot to the groin after Wheatcroft was handcuffed and restrained face down on 108-degree parking lot pavement by two other officers.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/no-immunity-for-officer-accused-of-shooting-man-in-genitals-with-taser/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.courthousenews.com/no-immunity-for-officer-accused-of-shooting-man-in-genitals-with-taser/">Courthouse New Service’s recounting of the incident</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jckr9HVE8Eg" target="_blank">Body camera video</a>&nbsp;shows officers approach Wheatcroft’s vehicle in a Motel 6 parking lot just after dusk on July 26, 2017. Schneider asks Wheatcroft and his wife, who was driving, to hand over ID. The officer said the car failed to use a turn signal when entering the parking lot.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheatcroft, a passenger, told the officer he did nothing wrong and refused to provide ID. Schneider then said he would take Wheatcroft to the police station. Schneider accused Wheatcroft of stuffing something between the car seats or in a bag by his feet, which Wheatcroft denied. Schneider then opened the passenger door, placed his Taser on Wheatcroft’s shoulder and told Schneider to relax his arm and stop tensing up.</em></p>
<p><em>According to Wheatcroft’s lawsuit, Schneider used his Taser on Wheatcroft 11 times. Body camera video shows Wheatcroft lying face down on the pavement with his shorts pulled down while Schneider deploys his Taser in an area that appears to be close to Wheatcroft’s genitals. The man’s children can be seen and heard crying and screaming, “No, daddy.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jckr9HVE8Eg" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jckr9HVE8Eg">video</a> is disturbing to watch. It even disturbed law enforcement professionals interviewed by ABC15, which first obtained the body cam footage.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Multiple independent law enforcement experts, who agreed to review the incident, said the officers’ conduct was unlawful, potentially criminal, and one of the most cruel and troubling cases of police misconduct they’ve ever seen.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have never seen anything like this before,” said Jeff Noble, an attorney and former deputy chief of police in Irvine, Calif., who’s testified in hundreds of cases including Tamir Rice and Philando Castile. “ It reminds me of a case in New York where an individual was sadistically taking a broom handle and shoving it up (the suspect’s) anus. This is just beyond the pale. It’s outrageous conduct.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was a classic pretextual stop. The stated reason was a failure to signal before pulling into the motel parking lot. That claim is also disputable, even though it’s not part of the claims being made by Wheatcroft in his lawsuit. <a href="https://www.loweringthebar.net/2022/03/jury-to-decide-whether-officers-have-qualified-immunity-for-tasing-a-guy-in-the-crotch.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.loweringthebar.net/2022/03/jury-to-decide-whether-officers-have-qualified-immunity-for-tasing-a-guy-in-the-crotch.html">Lowering the Bar’s coverage of this ruling</a> notes that security cam footage from the motel indicates the officers could not have seen the alleged no-signal turn from where they were originally parked.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>The incident happened in 2017, after officers made a traffic stop of a vehicle in a motel parking lot. Although by “traffic stop,” I mean they lied about seeing the car turn into the lot without signaling. That kind of technical violation might justify a stop, but here security-cam footage made it clear the officers could not have seen the car turn because they were a block away in a back alley at the time.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A defensive statement was issued by the Glendale PD shortly after body cam footage was released to the public. The statement, as ABC15 notes, is <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/glendale-police-department-releases-statement-to-abc15-on-body-camera-footage" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.abc15.com/news/local-news/investigations/glendale-police-department-releases-statement-to-abc15-on-body-camera-footage">clearly contradicted by both camera footage</a> and the <a href="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/38/16/a9b0389c4f13ad2d853dae5ece83/20190208162420349.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/38/16/a9b0389c4f13ad2d853dae5ece83/20190208162420349.pdf">department’s own internal investigation</a> of Officer Schneider.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>“The male suspect was complying with Officer Fernandez while your attention was directed towards the female suspect, who was now being taken into custody. The suspect’s feet were close to where you were standing, when the male suspect swung his legs around and appear to kick you. You reacted by kicking him in the groin. You stated you kicked the suspect in the groin with the tip of your right boot. You then placed your taser on his right buttock near his intergluteal cleft (taint) and drive-stunned the subject in the right lowerbuttocks/groin. The pain of the drive-stun caused him to kick away, hitting your taser. The subject stopped kicking and put his legs in the fetal position and was stood up by Officer Fernandez, when you delivered a second kick to his groin. </em></p>
<p><em>Based upon the suspect’s lack of resistance at the time of your use of force, review of the video-recordings, and subject matter expert review of all of the circumstances, the amount of force you used against the suspect was unreasonable and unnecessary. Therefore, the allegations against you are SUSTAINED.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even this reaction from the Glendale PD was delayed. The internal investigation wasn’t immediate. Nothing happened to the officer until ABC15 started asking questions. Here’s Lowering the Bar again:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>According to ABC15, initially no one was disciplined for this, and the department and city blew off its requests for comment. After the reports started to air, the department conducted an internal investigation, after which it suspended Schneider. For three days. (It was his fourth suspension.) But that was it, and prosecutors also declined to charge him. Only after the reports continued and the body-cam footage was released in 2019 did they reopen the case. Schneider is now, finally, a former police officer being charged with aggravated assault, and he’s also one of the defendants in the civil case. (He was allowed to retire on “accidental disability” so he gets to keep his pension.)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officer Schneider is now no longer technically an officer. That means he may not get indemnified if he loses the lawsuit filed against him by the man he subjected to multiple Taser deployments. (On the other hand, the public will still be paying his pension for years to come.) There’s no qualified immunity to be had, says the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21410819/taser-qi.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21410819/taser-qi.pdf">federal court</a> [PDF]. This is going to go in front of a jury. </p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Here, a genuine dispute exists as to whether Wheatcroft presented an immediate threat to the safety of the Officers. Officer Lindsey testified during his deposition that Wheatcroft was “reaching toward the middle console” and “continuing to reach” into the console after Officer Schneider gave him a command to stop. Officer Lindsey testified that he believed “[t]here could be a weapon in there. There could be<br>something that could harm the people in the vehicle, harm me, harm themselves.” Officer Schneider testified he went “hands on” with Wheatcroft “[b]ecause he started reaching down into the center console.” But Wheatcroft testified that during his conversation with the Officer, he was “trying to unbuckle his seat belt” and while the Officer had him in an arm bar, he was not pulling his arm away, the Officer was “twisting” his arm, which was “making [him] go down.” </em></p>
<p><em>The Officer Defendants assert that their methods of force were necessary given the “high crime area” around the Motel 6, Wheatcroft’s refusal to obey the Officers’ commands, Wheatcroft’s agitated demeanor, his use of obscenities, and his acts of tensing his arm and “shifting his hands in between his backpack and the center console.” But almost all of Defendants’ justification for their use of force against Wheatcroft is disputed: the parties dispute whether the Motel 6 had an active trespass agreement with the City of Glendale Police Department; whether Wheatcroft was moving his hands around the car and accessing his backpack; where the Taser struck on Wheatcroft’s body; and even whether Wheatcroft had to identify himself to the Officers in the first place.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, Wheatcroft was under no obligation to provide ID to Officer Schneider. The law used to charge Wheatcroft says a person is only obligated to do this if they are “lawfully detained based on reasonable suspicion” of committing a crime. The stated reason for the interaction was a failure to signal, which was a criminal infraction that could only be committed by the driver, not any of the passengers, including Wheatcroft.</p>
<p>Second, it’s pretty rich for an overly aggressive officer to claim a citizen’s “agitated manner” and “use of obscenities” justifies force deployment. Officer Schneider did both and yet no one would claim that his “agitated manner” and “use of obscenities” would justify resisting arrest or use of physical force against him. Heal thyself, you irony-proof ingrate.</p>
<p>The officer’s arguments aren’t really arguments, the court says. A jury will sort out the differences and decide whether tasering a handcuffed vehicle passenger was justified under the circumstances — a failure to signal traffic stop. (It also should be noted no illegal substances or weapons were discovered on Wheatcroft or in the vehicle.)</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>In light of all of the circumstances, a reasonable jury could conclude that the Officers’ substantial use of force against Wheatcroft outweighed the Officers’ need for its use. The Defendants have failed to show that the force they applied was objectively reasonable based on Wheatcroft’s version of the facts, which the Court must accept as true for the purposes of this motion. Accepting Wheatcroft’s version of the facts, a jury could find that the Officer’s use of force here was unreasonable. Wheatcroft was Tasered six times, forcibly removed from a car where he was a passenger, and handcuffed, all in about</em> <em>five minutes from when Officer Schneider first went “hands on” with Wheatcroft. Defendants do not argue that the amount of force the Officers used against Wheatcroft was small, but rather, was justified under the circumstances. But these circumstances—as the Defendants present them to the Court—all come from the point of view of the Defendants themselves. Thus, the Officers “have done little more than present their own version of the facts and ask the court to rule in their favor.</em>..”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ignorance of clearly settled law is no excuse.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p><em>Blankenhorn and Graham would adequately put a reasonable officer on notice that Tasing Wheatcroft six times to effectuate an arrest when he offered no resistance to the Officers, and even told them he was not resisting, was a Fourth Amendment violation. The law here was clearly established at the time of Wheatcroft’s arrest and gave the Officers sufficient notice.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the Glendale PD is smart, it will settle. If it isn’t, it will try to appeal this decision, increasing the cost to Glendale residents currently being underserved by their police department. They’re already paying for one officer’s retirement. There’s no reason they should be expected to fund further arguments against their own best interests.</p>

I've noticed a lot of people highlighting the enablement of Russian oligarch wealth by the UK.
It's not wrong, but I think there are some details being overlooked...
Namely that a lot of the trouble stems from the City of London.

You've directly referenced the failure to sanction by the UK ("the enablement of Russian oligarch wealth") , and then said that a key overlooked detail is "the trouble stems from the city of london".

If you didn't mean to make that connection, I invite you to clarify what trouble you were refering to.  In general, no one commenting on sanctions is saying anything for which the distinction matters.  Just like the fact that the mob built an unincorporated town to avoid taxes doesn't matter to anyone talking about Las Vegas.</span></li><li class="msg with-handle" title="3/15/2022, 2:20:26 PM"><span class="handle">John Roddy:</span> <span class="msg-text">I'm not trying to call out any one specific government here.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:20:51 PM"><span class="msg-text">Frankly, no country really walks away from this looking clean.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:21:43 PM"><span class="msg-text">The only detail that stuck out to me was potential of attributing actions in the City of London to the UK as a whole.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:22:46 PM"><span class="msg-text">Both of them are under scrutiny, but it is worth noting that City of London's unique global influence makes it a bit unusual here especially.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:23:21 PM"><span class="msg-text">And no, I'm not talking about failure to sanction at all.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:24:45 PM"><span class="msg-text">More the result of long-standing financial trends that gradually resulted in a bit of dependency on Russia, making it particularly more damaging to sanction.</span></li><li class="msg" title="3/15/2022, 2:24:58 PM"><span class="msg-text">Which, again, is something that all countries are dealing with.</span></li><li class="msg with-handle" title="3/15/2022, 3:21:40 PM"><span class="handle">deadspatula:</span> <span class="msg-text">So, when you say "Namely that a lot of the trouble stems from the City of London.", what trouble regarding the enablement of Russian oligarch wealth stems from the city of london?
