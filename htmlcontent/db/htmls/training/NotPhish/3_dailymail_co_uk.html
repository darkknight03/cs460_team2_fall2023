        Naomi Irion, 18, was last seen in parking lot of a Walmart on March 12 at 5am. On Monday, new surveillance footage shows the man pacing back and forth in the parking lot in the minutes prior to Naomi arriving and her abduction. It appears as though the man knew of her routine and was lying in wait. She was parked her car at the location to then take a bus to her job at Panasonic. Earlier surveillance footage released last week shows the man approaching her while she sat in the driver's seat of the car. He said something to her to make her move over to the passenger seat then the pair drove away, with him behind the wheel. Since then, police have found Naomi's abandoned car but there is no sign of her. The search effort has now increased both in size and scope to include law enforcement agencies from local, state and Federal levels.

      Two Pennsylvania state troopers and a man were run over and killed alongside I-95 in Philadelphia early Monday morning by a woman who had been stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence moments before. Troopers Martin F. Mack III, 33, and Branden T. Sisca, 29, were on the shoulder helping a man into the back of a cruiser when a woman tried to drive past the three men at a high speed just before 1am. 'The impact was so great that it threw the troopers over into the northbound lanes of Interstate 95,' Pennsylvania State Police Capt. James Kemm said in a press conference, according to KYW. Witnesses attempted CPR but all three men were pronounced dead at the scene. The woman who struck them had been stopped on suspicion of DUI moments earlier, but officers had to leave her after they got a call about a man walking down the highway.

       President Joe Biden said Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin's 'back is against the wall,' as he said Russia launched a 'hypersonic missile' at Ukraine in part due to the strength of Ukrainian defenses. 'They're wreaking havoc on on the, on the Russian military, whether it's their tanks or their helicopters or their aircraft,' Biden said. He spoke after the Kremlin claimed it used its state-of-the-art military hardware to take out a Ukrainian weapons storage facility. The Pentagon on Monday would not confirm the claim. 'And if you notice, they've just launched their hypersonic missile, because it's the only thing that they can get through without absolute certainty,' Biden said. 'It's, as you all know, it's a consequential weapon, but with the same warhead on it as any other launched missile – it doesn't make that much difference except it's almost impossible to stop it. There's a reason they're using it.'&nbsp;

       The airport told <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">DailyMail.com</span> that one of its public safety officers 'was in the ticket lobby and was asked to assist with a frustrated passenger.' A representative confirmed that a 'frustrated' Cruz had missed the check-in window for his flight, and that re-booking options were 'limited out of Bozeman due to Spring Break.' Cruz managed to rebook and depart later that evening, Bozeman airport deputy director Scott Humphrey said. It's not clear what Cruz or the airport employees were saying in the short clip. The Texas Republican had been wearing a mask, in compliance with federal COVID-19 guidelines. The 23-second video, which appears to be taken from behind the employee desk of the main airport foyer, shows Cruz vigorously nodding his head in visible annoyance. His mouth is covered by a mask that says 'Come and take it' in reference to the Second Amendment.

       Republicans on Monday signaled that President Joe Biden's Supreme Court nominee Kentanji Brown Jackson can expect tough days of questioning when they opened her confirmation hearing with reminders of the bitter attacks on Justice Brett Kavanaugh and by linking her to dark money groups. Biden last month nominated Jackson, 51, for a lifetime job on America's top judicial body to succeed retiring liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, setting up a confirmation battle in the closely divided Senate. If confirmed, she would be the first black woman to sit on the nation's highest court.

            William and Kate&nbsp;(Pictured) visited the British Army Training Support Unit (BATSUB) on Monday, which delivers tropical environment training to troops from the UK alongside international partners,&nbsp;and is manned by 12 permanent staff and employs more than 100 locals. They both learnt invaluable survival tips first-hand from troops and drank fresh water from jungle vines before showing off their impeccable fashion taste for an evening reception&nbsp;hosted by the Governor General of Belize in celebration of Her Majesty The Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The event was held at the Mayan ruins at Cahal Pech near the town of San Ignacio in the Cayo District of Belize, and celebrated the very best of Belizean culture. Kate was pictured wearing a shimmering £2,500 pink gown by British designer, The Vampire's Wife, which she paired with silver heeled sandals and a Mayan embroidered clutch bag.

            More than 11,000 people have signed a <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Change.org</span> petition (inset) created by a CUNY John Jay College student claiming that the opera show is all about 87-year-old playwright Clare Cross' (left) 'white guilt'. Emmett Till (right) was lynched in Mississippi in August 1955, aged just 14. The youngster was killed by a group of white racists after he was accused of 'offending' a white woman in a grocery store by flirting with her. His murder remains one of the most notorious race-hate killings in US history and helped galvanize the movement of civil rights protests against racial injustice. The show, which features black composer Mary D. Watkins' work, 'explores themes of social justice, the flaws within the justice system, white silence and allyship, racial inequality and the complexities of the human experience,' its synopsis reads.

       The plunge of a Chinese airline plane would have knocked out everyone on board due to G-force but one or more of the pilots 'regained consciousness' for a '10 to 20 second spell' in a last ditch attempt to save the aircraft, an expert has suggested. China Eastern has grounded all of its Boeing 737-800 aircraft today after 132 people died when their passenger jet crashed in China this morning after suddenly nose-diving and plummeting 30,000ft in two minutes and hitting the ground at 350mph. State media reported all 737-800s in the airline's fleet were ordered grounded. The model is the predecessor to the controversial 737 Max model but is regarded as safe despite a series of crashes over its long history. Aviation expert Sally Gethin said there is no suggestion of 'foul play' so far, saying the 'startle effect' is common and difficult to train for. She added: 'Pilots can get overwhelmed or disorientated by sudden events. This is known as the startle effect, and it is every hard to train for.' (Pictured right, CCTV footage seemingly showing the jet plunging down. Top left, a wildfire caused by the smash. Bottom left, rescuers set out to the plane crash site.

       Christina McFadden (right), of Norco, said her daughter and her 5-and-4-year-old classmates (right) were denied the chance to form their own beliefs and did not fully understand what was going on. Instead, the outraged mother said a teacher at the private Turning Point Christian School (inset), who the school said was 'talked to' but will not be fired, indoctrinated the children. McFadden reached out to school officials who offered an apology and took down the video. She was also informed the teacher will not be fired.

            Vadim Sorokin, 58, sat down for an exclusive interview with <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">DailyMail.com</span> in which he said his daughter's spending is out of control even in detention. He also shared pictures of his daughter from when she was growing up in Russia and Germany. He said Anna, 31, has the ability to wrap people around her little finger and is paying other inmates in the Orange County jail to do chores for her. Vadim said he would welcome Anna back if she chose to move home, but Anna blasted back, saying she would 'rather be in jail than live with her parents'

       Eli Rallo, 23, joined Sigma Kappa when she was at the University of Michigan. She recently shared an old email breaking down how active members had to rank potential new members. They had to assign each young woman a number between one and four, based on a five-minute conversation. She called it&nbsp;'disgusting, 'misogynistic,' and a 'nightmare' and said she couldn't skip it because she'd be fined. She admitted to sabotaging the process by giving well-liked girls low scores and not-well-liked girls high scores.

            Ukrainian-born New York City councilwoman Inna Vernikov recalls standing in long lines for a grocery ticket only to find 'bare shelves' under the Soviet Union, and is terrified about the 'comeback' of socialism she is finding in the U.S. One of five Republicans on the 51-person city council, Vernikov's escape from Ukraine under the Soviet Union and rise to immigration and divorce attorney and later councilwoman drew the interest of even former President Trump. The 37-year-old who represents South Brooklyn on the NYC council caught up with <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">DailyMail.com</span> upon returning from her trip to Florida to meet with Trump.

        The Pentagon said on Monday it had seen clear evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine as it emerged that the U.S. was shipping Soviet-era air defense systems to bolster Ukrainian resistance.

            Two multimillion dollar mansions in Colorado that are owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich are prime targets to be frozen by the U.S. government if the billionaire is sanctioned by the White House. Abramovich has been sanctioned in the UK and Canada&nbsp;in response to the war in Ukraine but not in the European Union or the U.S. as of Monday morning. The White House will make a decision about whether or not to include&nbsp;Abramovich in its next round of sanctions, according to CNBC.&nbsp;If sanctioned, it's likely that Abramovich's two properties in Colorado would be the first to go. The Russian&nbsp;billionaire owns a sleek 14,000-square-foot modern mega-home perched nearly 1,000 feet above Snowmass Village on Wildcat Ridge, secluded at the end of a remote road on 200 acres in Snowmass, Colorado, just outside of Aspen. He purchased the home for&nbsp;in 2008 for $36.5 million. It's now estimated to be valued at $50 million. The only other property nearby is just down the narrow mountain road, his 5,500-square-foot chalet-style home in Snowmass Village, which CNBC reports he purchased in 2008 for $11.8 million. Abramovich also owns&nbsp;several New York properties, most notably the stretch along the Upper East Side, which he began acquiring in 2014, for a total of $90 million.

       Jill Biden, 70, released a video Monday with some of the cast of Sesame Street to spread some 'kindness' and told kids to be nice to 'monsters' in sharing the word of the day. 'Hi, I'm Jill Biden and I'm here with my good friend Gabrielle,' First Lady Biden said from the famous PBS set during a Sesame Workshop Coming Together clip. 'Hi, we're here to tell you the word of the day,' said Gabrielle, a 6-year-old muppet who was first introduced to the Sesame Street cast in 2018.

            Robert I. Shinn is the founder of 7M films and is also a pastor of Shekinah Church in California. He has gained newfound notoriety after the family of one of his biggest TikTok stars Miranda Derrick claimed he was keeping her against her will in a religious cult. Miranda and her husband James are believed to be living in Los Angeles together though it remains unclear exactly where. They spend much of their time at the 7M mansion, along with the group's other dancers, filming TikTok content for Shinn and his son, Isaiah, who works as a director.

       Former Attorney General Bill Barr slammed President Joe Biden for lying about the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop. 'I was very disturbed during the debate when candidate Biden lied to the American people about the laptop.&nbsp;He's squarely confronted with the laptop, and he suggested that it was Russian disinformation and pointed to the letter written by some intelligence people that was baseless - which he knew was a lie,' Barr said Monday on Fox. 'And I was shocked by that.'

        UNGAR-SARGON: Conservatives have long decried bias against them from socially liberal Silicon Valley. But it's actually much worse than that. It's a bias in favor of those in power-in favor of elites.

       Rowan MacKenzie began doomsday preparations for her family over a decade ago after growing afraid that things could 'go south'. She started out by filling her cupboards with long-life good, such as rice and beans, but eventually began making more extreme preparations. This included spending $10,000 to have a bunker installed in her basement, which she has now filled with weapons (guns pictured bottom inset), supplies, and two years' worth of food. MacKenzie now educates other people on doomsday prep via her social media accounts, racking up more than 75,500 followers on TikTok alone. She believes that weapons are one of the most important aspects of doomsday prep, because they can be used both for defense and for hunting food. Rowan says that most of her food stock will last up to 25 years and she has implemented a 'flawless' rotation system to ensure there isn't any waste.

            DAN WOOTTON: Seeing Lia Thomas tower over biological women at the NCAA championships was madness... Trans athletes need to be told in no uncertain terms they cannot compete outside their biological sex.

       Opponents of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus are uniting with a petition demanding that Switzerland expels the strongman's 'lover' Alina Kabaeva amid claims she is hiding with their secret children in a luxury villa. Kabaeva, 38 (pictured left in December, right with Putin, and inset during a competition in 1999), is a former Olympic gymnast and gold medalist who is widely believed to be Putin's mistress and mother to secret children whom he has never officially recognised. The petition comes amid reports that Kabaeva was sent to a private chalet in Switzerland earlier this month amid the invasion of Ukraine. 'It's time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,' the strongly-worded petition said. 'Despite the current war, Switzerland continues to host an accomplice of Putin's regime.' However, there is no independently verified evidence that Kabaeva is in Switzerland, while other reports suggest she is hiding in one of Putin's retreats in Siberia.

       Fresh CCTV footage (left and top right) of Russian soldiers driving their tank to a gas station in Kherson, Ukraine, to loot for food has highlighted the logistical problems faced by Putin's ill-prepared invasion force. Kherson is the first and only major Ukrainian city to have fallen fully under Russian control, but there have been widespread reports of fuel supply issues and food shortages as the Ukrainian army and civilian defence forces continue to fight the invaders. Western intelligence suggests the Kremlin's troops were not prepared for a protracted military conflict, and their advances have been largely stalled, leaving frontline troops desperate for food. It comes amid reports that captured Russian troops were found to be carrying rations that had expired several years ago, while many of those who were taken as prisoners or surrendered have protested they did not want to go to war in Ukraine (bottom right: Russian armoured vehicle smoulders after a Ukrainian counter attack)

            Keanu Reeves was seen taking his flashy new wheels for a spin as he and girlfriend Alexandra Grant enjoyed some rare downtime together in Los Angeles.&nbsp; The couple, who went public with their romance in November 2019, both seemed to be in good spirits and were dressed casually while stepping out for errands earlier this month on March 2.&nbsp; The Matrix star, 57, who is known to have a huge passion for motorbikes and co-runs a highly successful company named Arch Motorcycles - also had a brand new bike delivered to his home.&nbsp;&nbsp;He chatted to a driver before moving a vintage Norton motorbike from his garage onto a waiting truck, presumably for repair work as it took several attempts to start up before he could drive it onto the ramp. He was then handed a new 'Arch' bike, which he later took for a spin in West Hollywood.

            NBCUniversal announced Sunday that The Maury Show show well end later this year with&nbsp;Povich, 83, heading into retirement. FEMAIL looks back at five shocking moments from its three decades on air/ Two women learned on air that their fraternal twins had different dads - which Maury admitted was the 'most surprised I ever was.' The most frequent guest was&nbsp;Sholonda, who appeared 19 times and got 20 DNA tests for her three children, including 17 for just one daughter. In 2017, Maury welcomed on model Martina Big, a white woman from Germany who 'identifies as a black woman.' Another episode showed a man cheating on his wife in the greenroom - which he denied, even when confronted with the footage.

       Guthrie, 50, (left and right) and Kotb, 57, (right) detailed their struggles with infertility while starring on the cover of the April 2022 issue of Good Housekeeping together. Guthrie, who has a seven-year-old daughter, Vale, and a five-year-old son, Charley (inset), admitted that she once doubted she would ever have children. She was fourth months pregnant with Vale when she married her husband, Michael Feldman, in 2014. After welcoming their daughter in August of that year, she had a miscarriage and did two rounds of IVF to get pregnant with her son. Kotb, who is mom to adopted daughters Haley, five, and Hope, two, also spent years thinking that parenthood wasn't in the cards for her. She was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 42 years old and came out of treatment unable to conceive. Kotb credited her ex-fiancé, Joel Schiffman, with helping her become a mom, saying she doesn't&nbsp;think she 'would've adopted if it hadn't been for Joel.'

       Jasmine Bell, 20, from Chicago, weighed 264 pounds and ate mainly fast food when she started her journey three years ago. By focusing on eating a healthy diet and becoming more active, she lost 88 pounds and is now a college athlete. Bell, who now weighs 176 pounds, has been sharing videos detailing her transformation on TikTok because she wants to inspire others. One clip that shows her before and after her weight loss has been viewed more than 1.2 million times, and viewers can't believe it is the same person.

       A viral video of a woman planting kisses on the backs of unsuspecting men during St Patrick's Day celebrations in Sydney (pictured) has been slammed online. While the woman seems very amused with her prank, many people have voiced their criticism and anger, saying doing this without the men's knowledge was not on. Some said the lipstick mark would be 'unexplainable' and could 'ruin' the men's relationships while others said the act was inappropriate considering the men did not give permission.

            OnlyFans has become a household name in the West thanks to high-profile users like Bella Thorne, Blac Chyna and Jessika Power, but the racy website has yet to make waves in Asia. But that may be about to change, with Bomi of South Korean girl group Girl Crush becoming the first ever K-pop singer to join OnlyFans. 'I've opened my OnlyFans,' she announced on Twitter last week. 'You can subscribe for $15. A sexy photo and fancam will be uploaded!'

       Like something from a horror film, the new robot's 'magnetic tentacle' would slowly creep into the mouth of a patient under under general anesthesia, University of Leeds scientists show. Guided by the external magnets, it could reach some of the smallest bronchial tubes in the lungs - and could be used to take tissue samples or deliver cancer therapy. The device has been published as a proof-of-concept in a new paper, although researchers admit it may be several years before 'magnetic tentacle' technology is available in a hospital setting.

       A Tesla driver was filmed flying 50ft through the air one of L.A.'s steepest streets on Saturday in what is believed to have been a stunt for TikTok.&nbsp; The LAPD is looking for the driver and wading through hundreds of tips identifying him as TikTok and YouTube influencer&nbsp;Dominykas Zeglaitis, who goes by the online name Durte Dom.&nbsp;&nbsp; He took credit for the stunt in multiple TikTok videos, claiming he was high on THC gummies at the time. Others however say he was not there, and is trying to profit off of the viral video by selling the gummies he claimed made him high enough to carry out the stunt.&nbsp;

            Hilarious interior design fails captured in an online gallery, collated by BoredPanda from the Facebook group 'beds with threatening auras', reveals some of the strangest beds around the world. This giant, foot-themed bed, shared by a Russian social media user, left internet users cringing. Let's hope this shell (centre) doesn't clamp shut in the night. Right: Taking Bed, Bath and Beyond to a very literal level.

            Internet users from around the world were left confused by the viral drawing, claiming their 'brains were broken' because image looked more like a seal or a donkey.. The illusion even left author J.K. Rowling stumped, with the Harry Potter writer admitting on Twitter that she saw a donkey the picture, instead of a mermaid or a fish. The viral puzzle claims to be based on the theory that different parts of the brain carry out different functions, meaning they're more likely to spot a certain animal based on whether their brain is predominantly left or right sided.

       According to Italian press, Marta Fascina, 32, an MP in Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, was 'offended and very angry' about not having a proper wedding to the billionaire (pictured left, together, and right, on their wedding day). Despite the fact it wasn't an official ceremony,&nbsp;Marta looked every bit the blushing bride, donning a floor length white Antonio Riva gown crafted from French lace&nbsp;with a train 3.5m long and sweeping her long blonde locks into a high bun for the occasion (main and insets, the wedding venue and place settings).

       Alex Murphy, 34, an American living London, filmed herself making her boyfriend Paul Klein, 30, a steaming hot cup of tea and filmed it for TikTok, racking up 10 million views. In the clip, Alex adds cold tap water to a mug with a teabag inside, before adding milk and sugar, and then places it in the microwave to heat. Horrified Paul asks: 'What is that? That is disgusting. Sorry, I don't mean to be rude - but that is not a cup of tea.'

       A Wisconsin wildlife rehab took in three eight-week-old bear cubs after their mother was killed in a research accident. Wild Instincts, an animal rehab center in Rhinelander, took in the tottering baby bears after their mother was suffocated in their den. An older, two-year-old 125-pound cub rolled onto her head while the bears were tranquilized during a routine replacement of the mama bear's radio collar. Mark Naniot, the director of Wild Instincts, said last week on Wisconsin Public Radio's 'The Morning Show' that he wasn't sure what the researchers were studying - regardless, he said, 'humans broke it, so we should fix it.' Researchers rushed to get the orphaned bears to the wildlife rehab within two and a half hours, Naniot said.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, they are just taking their first wobbly steps. They are being bottle fed and eating well, he said, and have doubled in size since early February. Baby bears are one of the most expensive animals cared for by the clinic, costing roughly $3,000 to $4,000 each for the eight or so months until they are around 100 pounds and can be released into the wild. Staffers at the clinic have been putting in 16 and 17 hour shifts seven days a week to cater to their around-the-clock needs while still caring for the other animals at the facility - 'we're cleaning toilets one minute and feeding bears the next minute. So, it's a situation where we have to basically do it all.'

       Footage shows an escalator at Xinpu Station on the Taipei Metro in the Taiwanese capital speeding backwards in an incident earlier this month as passengers tried to reach the ticket hall from the Blue Line. After the incident, Taipei Metro admitted escalators played a part in almost half of the 337 injuries sustained at the railway in 2020. In that year alone compensation payouts hit more than NT$3.72million (£99,211). According to the news site Baidu, the ascending escalator suddenly plummeted without warning while around 30 passengers were standing on it. Three commuters sustained minor cuts and scrapes in the accident on March 11, while one person sprained their ankle.

       The 10ft reptile was hiding in a broken car engine in a family's garage in Chanthaburi province, eastern Thailand on March 15. Shocked homeowner Tippawan Bunnak, 49, contacted the reptile specialists to have the deadly snake removed. The team arrived and found it still curled inside the rusty engine. The snake was aggressive and tried to attack the volunteers, who finally managed to capture it. The king cobra turned its head back several times in an attempt to attack the team members but it was eventually controlled.

       This is the queasy moment a carnival-goer was spun in endless circles on a faulty fairground ride. Footage shows the man trying to fight motion sickness while his seat spun out of control in Bulacan province, near Manila, in the Philippines, earlier this month. When the fairground ride finished, the other seats stopped spinning, except for his. Although he at first seemed to be laughing, he later put his head in his hands as the seat continued to spin. Rust was blamed for the malfunction and the rider eventually got off, unhurt but dizzy.
