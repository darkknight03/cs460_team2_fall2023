        President Joe Biden on Thursday said there will be food shortages around the globe because of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 'It's going to be real,' he said. 'Because both Russia and Ukraine have been the breadbasket of Europe in terms of wheat, for example.' Food security, along with general humanitarian assistance, was one of the main topics of conversation in Biden's trifecta of emergency meetings with NATO leaders, the European Union, and the G7. The summits were called to deal with the invasion of the Ukraine.

      The 29 messages are reportedly part of the vast tranche of documents Meadows handed over to the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack. 'Mark (don't want to wake you) ...&nbsp;Sounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down,' a message Thomas supposedly sent to Meadows on November 19 reads. 'Release the Kraken' is a phrase that was popularized by Powell referring to the alleged uncovering of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. It's commonly used among the far-right fringe of Trump supporters.

            Donald Trump on Thursday filed a lawsuit against Hillary Clinton and a hit list of his favorite targets, alleging they tried to rig the 2016 U.S. presidential election by tying his campaign to Russia. Among the names are Christopher Steele, a former British spy who assembled a dossier of alleged links between Trump and Russia, James Comey, the then director of the FBI who investigated possible connections, and the Democratic National Committee. 'In the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton and her cohorts orchestrated an unthinkable plot - one that shocks the conscience and is an affront to this nation's democracy,' reads the complaint.

       President Joe Biden said sanctions were never meant to 'deter' Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, saying they were meant to increase 'the pain' and if sustained force a change. 'You're playing a game with me,' Biden told the CBS reporter who pressed him on Russia policy. He said sanctions, with a new round announced Thursday, would stay in place a year. White House officials say they are crippling Russia's economy and tanking the ruble.

            The E4-B Nightwatch flew to RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk from Edwards Air Force Base yesterday ahead of President Joe Biden's visit to Brussels to meet the leaders of NATO, the G7 and the EU. Earlier this week, a senior Kremlin official warned that Moscow reserved the right to use nuclear weapons if there was an 'existential threat' against the country.

            A shocking new report details just how much of the $350 billion given to states and localities to fight coronavirus went toward unrelated projects. Democrats pumped $1.9 trillion into the economy through the American Rescue Plan to bring back jobs lost during the pandemic, help those short on cash due to job loss, reopen schools and launch a nationwide vaccination campaign. Of that $350 billion in emergency funding was made available to states, local and tribal governments, with little restriction on how they put it to use. President Biden has already requested another $22.5 billion, his administration warning that without it they won't be able to keep up their supply of vaccines and coronavirus treatments. Republicans have already balked at the request for more funds, and the few who were open to the prospect could be turned off seeing hundreds of millions in funding were appropriated to projects unrelated to the virus.

       Danielle Green (inset) was voted out of her presidency on the Flint Community School Board 6-0 on Wednesday during an emergency meeting. She allegedly attacked school Treasurer&nbsp;Laura McIntyre (left) by 'grabbing her throat, slamming her head down on the table, and punching her repeatedly in the head.' McIntyre said she would pursue the 'full extent' of the law and has filed a police report against Green. Green said this doesn't 'define her or her record of service' and that she isn't 'proud' of the moment. Green's boyfriend (right)said in a Facebook Live video that people need to 'get the full story' before believing what McIntyre said. He claimed that 'Danielle just looking out for the kids. She wanted to bring new schools.'

       Former college classmates of Lauren Pazienza have described her as, 'pure trouble,' and 'a danger,' who was prone to violence and have shared exclusive video with <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">DailyMail.com</span> in which the New York events coordinator can be seen (left) allegedly 'mocking' deaf people. Both sources, who asked to remain anonymous, knew Pazienza when the 26-year-old was a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. One friend said Pazienza was allegedly prone to mocking people and spoke in a derogatory manner, they said 'about fat people and deaf people…anyone.' In footage shared with <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">DailyMail.com</span> Pazienza can be seen contorting and making a grotesque face, screeching and speaking in a distorted voice that, the friend said, was her 'mocking deaf people.' In another video (right) she is filmed in her dorm room in bra and jacket behaving in an odd and, the source said, attention-grabbing manner. Pazienza, who is said to have grown up in affluence in Long Island, is being held on manslaughter charges for fatally shoving 87-year-old vocal coach Barbara Gustern in a random attack on March 10.

            Defense attorneys showed jurors writings from Claudia Drury, 31, in which she described her work as a prostitute as 'awesome.' In one graphic entry she told how she had used a strap-on sex toy on a male police officer, describing it as 'really, really cool.' In another, she wrote: 'I love what I do and believe I am doing something good for myself and my clients.' The journal was produced in the federal case against Larry Ray, 62, who is accused of running a 'sex cult' out of his daughter's dorm room at Sarah Lawrence College in New York.

       Ten years, two years, three months? Those are the widely varied figures at the center of a case Republicans are hammering Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson over, U.S. v. Hawkins, a case involving an 18-year-old convicted of sharing child pornography online. Jackson sentenced the young adult to three months in federal prison, though federal sentencing guidelines recommended 10 years and prosecutors had sought two. Sens. Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz and others have all repeatedly posed the question, why? Wesley Hawkins, six years later, has not given up on his sick infatuation with children, according to records shared with the Washington Post. In 2019, Jackson ordered Hawkins to serve the last six months of his six-year supervision period in a halfway house, after he was found to be seeking out 'sexually arousing, non-pornographic material.'

            MEGHAN MCCAIN: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's ridiculous refusal to define the word 'woman' has exposed the absurdity of the progressive left's extreme gender and identity politics

            MCCAIN: Judge Jackson is undoubtedly an intelligent woman, probably a brilliant woman, which is why I was surprised and disappointed when Judge Jackson refused to answer Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn when she was asked to define the word 'woman.' In a truly head-scratching moment, Judge Jackson said she couldn't answer that question because she is 'not a biologist.' Now, I don't entirely blame Judge Jackson for this utterly ridiculous statement. I am sure the judge had been coached to avoid wading into politicized issues, of which gender has become one of the most divisive. But the harsh reality is that we are now at a place in American society when a nominee for the Supreme Court cannot say if women are real or not. Women have certain live experiences that help define us. And if a biological man can become a biological woman - then where are we left?

            Claire Bridges from St. Petersburg, Florida was fully vaccinated when she tested positive for COVID-19 in early January. She was born with a&nbsp;congenital heart condition and was soon hospitalized, requiring life support. She suffered liver damage, kidney failure, and muscle deterioration called rhabdomyolysis, which led to doctors amputating her legs. It was a month before&nbsp;Bridges could sit up again, and two months before she was able to go home. She has remained positive, and her father said she was happy to be alive. On Saturday, she celebrated her 21st birthday at home with friends and family, smiling in a wheelchair with her legs still bandaged.

            All six girls who were tragically killed when a truck collided with their car at an Oklahoma intersection near Tishomingo have been named by friends and family. Above from left to right: Gracie Machado, Addison Gratz, Madison Robertson, Memory Wilson, Brooklyn Triplett, and Austin Holt were named by their loved ones on social media. The truck driver was identified on Wednesday as Valendon Burton, 51, a rock hauler and doting grandfather whose semi hit their car as it was apparently attempting to turn across his lane and onto U.S. Highway 377 near Tishomingo. The six high school students were packed into a small, 2015 Chevy Spark with just four seats - and only the two teenaged girls riding in the front seat were wearing seatbelts, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Wednesday. The six girls were all students of Tishomingo Public School, according to the district's superintendent. The driver was 16 years old, three of the other girls were 15 and the other two passengers were both 17.&nbsp;

       Stodden, who is&nbsp;is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, married Hutchison in 2011, when they were 16 and he was just days away from turning 51. They&nbsp;faced widespread media scrutiny, received death threats, and was labeled a 'whore' for marrying the actor with their mother&nbsp;Krista Keller's legal consent. Speaking with Alex Cooper on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Stodden described how Hutchison connected with them under the guise of being their acting coach. The TV personality said they spent six months speaking online and over the phone, claiming he knew their age and what they looked like from the beginning. Stodden said they met in person for the first time the week before they married. They recalled being a virgin on their wedding night and fearing that he would be put off by their body because they 'looked like a 12-year-old' without clothes. Stodden alleged that Hutchison emotionally and physically abused them, saying he also forced them to do reality television to make money. During the interview, they also touched upon how celebrities like Chrissy Teigen publicly bullied them and contributed to their depression and low self-worth. Stodden had separated from Hutchison a couple of times during their marriage, but they were groomed to feel like they 'couldn't live without him.' They recalled running back to him after being sexually assaulted twice while they were separated. Stodden alleged that after they left Hutchison and filed for divorce in 2018, they found out that he was 'pursuing a 15-year-old girl in the UK.' They also claimed that they helped attorneys get him away from the teen, saying he sent the same emails and letters he had sent her. Stodden, who is now engaged to their boyfriend Chris Sheng, vowed to never speak to Hutchison ever again.

       Flames and thick black smoke was seen rising over the port of Berdyansk, in southern Ukraine, on Thursday morning (left, inset and bottom right) after a Ukrainian missile hit and destroyed a 370ft Russian Alligator-class landing ship - identified by Kyiv's navy as the Orsk. Video shows the vessel was sitting in the dock alongside two smaller ships when it was struck and engulfed by flames, as the two other boats quickly sailed away - one of which also suffered damage. If it is confirmed that the Orsk was destroyed it will be an especially embarrassing loss for Russia, because state media filmed the ship at the port just three days ago unloading reinforcements and giving away its location (top right). Its loss marks the largest ship that Ukraine has destroyed so-far and another blunder for Vladimir Putin's beleaguered invasion. It comes after NATO estimated Putin has lost up to a quarter of the troops he amassed for the attack who have been either killed, wounded or captured - a punishing casualty rate for what was supposed to be a days-long war that has now entered its second month.

            MARK GALEOTTI: The war in Ukraine has turned into a disaster and everyone is looking for other people to blame. Anyone can be denounced as a warmonger or a traitor, or even both. Naturally, the seething atmosphere of mistrust is being stoked by intelligence services both in Ukraine and the West. The counter-intelligence campaigns are aimed in particular at the FSB, the successor to the KGB, which is the keystone of Putin's government.

            JAN MOIR: Let's face it , William and Kate's Jamaican tour is a disaster. If this is the shape of things to come, one can only fear for the future of the monarchy itself. You can see the chronicle of its death foretold in every moment from the Trench Town bongo-bashing to emeralds and apologies at the governor's dinner in Kingston: the speeches are squirming, the dutiful set pieces are a cringe, the optics are bad.

            The Duchess of Cambridge (pictured right) stepped out today in a custom lace Alexander McQueen dress as she joined Prince William at the Jamaica Defence Force Commissioning Parade on day six of their tour of the Caribbean. Paired with a white cartwheel-style hat, the ensemble is reminiscent of an outfit worn by the monarch (pictured left) to a garden party in Sydney on her&nbsp;1954 tour of Australia shortly after her coronation.

            Full House star Dave Coulier has shared an alarming photograph of his bloodied up face from a fall as he revealed he is an alcoholic just two months after the death of castmate Bob Saget. The 62-year-old actor took to Instagram to share the alarming snap along with a lengthy caption talking about his alcohol use disorder and his road to sobriety which has lasted over two years. He began the long caption for the dramatic photo by writing: 'I was a drunk. Yes. An alcoholic. I've been alcohol free since January 1, 2020. When I drank, I was the life of the party. I could make people laugh until they fell down. In this picture I was the one who fell down.'

       The projector broke at a screening of The Lost City at&nbsp;AMC Burbank 16 on Tuesday night. While the theater spent over a half hour fixing it, comedian Tiffany King stood at the front of the room and performed a 15-minute standup set. She said her eight-year-old daughter, who was with her, dared her to/ Moviegoers life-tweeted the experience, not all that flatteringly, and even shared video of the performance. One viral clip shows King chanting in gibberish, singing opera, and jumping around. Though she was heckled during the performance - and many commenters have found it cringe-worthy - the audience did applaud when she finished.

       Codenamed 'Purosangue', which translates to 'Thoroughbred', the company's first foray into the 4X4 market put it head-to-head against Aston Martin's DBX and Lamborghini's Urus in the 'super-SUV' segment, with prices for the stallion-adorned performance car starting at around £200,000. While the name is still yet to be confirmed, this image shared on Ferrari's Instagram account shows a high-riding model with design features taken from its low-slung supercars.

       Undercover political commentator Steven Crowder posed as a fat pride activist and was able to submit a paper at academic conference on fatness that was widely praised. Crowder, who heads the political podcast and YouTube channel Louder With Crowder, posted his 2020 prank 'Crowder infiltrates 'fat Studies' to his YouTube channel on Wednesday. For his prank Crowder poses as independent scholar and fat pride activist Sea Matheson of Austin, Texas, complete with full make up and prosthetics. Crowder's prank sought to expose the 'farce' of the fat studies discipline by infiltrating the annual fat studies academic conference at Massey University. Massey submitted a paper titled: 'Embracing Fatness as Self-Care in the Era of Trump' which was accepted and he was invited to speak at the conference virtually.

       Aspyn Ovard, from Utah, opened up about her drinking experiences in a TikTok post, which quickly went viral, receiving over 371,000 views in less than a day. The mother-of-two was responding to a question from a follower, who asked whether she has 'ever been drunk', adding: 'I think you would be hilarious'. Aspyn, who married her high school sweetheart Parker, with whom she has two daughters, responded that 'the answer is no', adding that it 'doesn't sound fun'. She went on to explain that she doesn't want to risk blacking out and forgetting what she did or said on a night out - a comment that sparked upset among some. Several people pointed out in the comments section that getting drunk doesn't mean you blackout or forget your night, while others urged her to try it. Others defended Aspyn, questioning why so many were telling her to drink, leading the influencer to say: 'I think a lot of people have&nbsp;drinking problems and don't realize.'

            ANNE DE COURCY: Daring front-slit skirt suits revealing a layer of lace. Sculpted jackets worn over voluminous trousers.&nbsp; Exquisite coats in a rainbow of pastel shades. Tweed was back in force on the Chanel catwalk this month. A Chanel model is pictured left in 1958, while Coco is pictured right at the races with the Duke of Westminster in 1933. Chanel's Autumn/ Winter collection is seen right in Paris this month. Tweed's renaissance also has a particular poignancy, since threaded through its many incarnations is the story of a love affair which revolutionised fashion history. For it was when Coco Chanel was staying at the Highland home of her lover, the Duke of Westminster, in 1928 that she first fell in love with the fabric.

       Cristina Castillo Alonso, from Barcelona, posted the heartwarming scene to TikTok on Monday. Footage shows her boyfriend Álvaro González Iglesias putting his hand up to a donkey's mouth as it starts gently nibbling it. But the couple's large white fluffy dog Coco seems afraid the donkey will bite Mr Iglesias. The dog reaches up a paw and gently bats his hand out of the donkey's reach.

       Daredevil Yanis Terzis, 35, from Campinas, Brazil filmed himself gliding over the famous Egyptian pyramids near Cairo, the tallest of which is 481 feet high. Breathtaking footage shows him casually steering his paramotor around the ancient monuments, starting with a pyramid. He edges nearer and nearer and seems dangerously close to smashing into the pyramid but his feet end up just skimming over the top. He also films a bird's eye view of the Sphinx in Giza.
