government gives the green light to do so.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Speaking to the Long Island Association at a Thursday morning meeting, Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman and CEO Janno Lieber said the agency will not require riders to cover their faces once the Transportation Security Administration drops its mask mandate for all indoor transportation facilities. The TSA recently extended the rule through April 18. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Even as mask requirements have been dropped in most indoor settings in New York, the TSA rule makes masks mandatory in trains, enclosed stations, buses, airports and planes. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “The MTA will not be initiating a separate mask initiative if the feds remove it,” Lieber said. “Mask mandates have come off in the rest of society. I don’t want people getting into arguments on the railroad and on the subway. … So we’re hoping that [the federal government] will remove it.”\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e MTA and labor officials have said the agency’s mask requirement has led to an increase in confrontations on trains involving riders and transit employees. Felony assaults on the LIRR more than doubled between 2020 and 2021, from 10 to 21, according to MTA Police.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Lieber on Thursday also revealed the likely name of the LIRR’s second Manhattan station: “Grand Central-Madison.”\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The name is expected to replace most references to “East Side Access” — the $11.2 billion megaproject that has been riddled with delays and budget overruns since construction began 15 years ago.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “We’re still playing with the words, but the idea is that ‘East Side Access’ is the term for a project that struggled to get done over many moons,” Lieber said. “The ‘East Side Access’ name is going away. We’re building a branding identity around Grand Central, because that’s what people know and understand. That’s the landmark they all want to go to.”\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Also coming in December is the LIRR’s new $2.6 billion Third Track, spanning Floral Park to Hicksville. Despite a lengthy legal battle with the Village of Garden City that held up construction, Lieber said the project remains “on schedule, and it’s under budget.”\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e And, Lieber revealed, an ongoing effort to widen the walkway and raise the ceiling along the LIRR’s customer concourse in Penn Station could be complete by the end of 2022 — sooner\u0026nbsp;than the original forecast of early next year.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “This is a big year for Long Island. … These are game changers. This is going to increase property values, spur economic growth, create new jobs, and have a multiplier effect on our economy,” said Long Island Association president Matthew Cohen, who also welcomed renaming the LIRR’s new link to Grand Central Terminal. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “East Side Access has been what it’s been called for decades,\u0026quot; Cohen said.\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;But it’s time to give this stop a real identity, so people can relate to it more … I think a fresh name, a fresh look, a fresh start — it’s all good stuff.”\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T21:07:12.562Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T22:04:16.578Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/mask-mandate-lirr-x7r42nas","headline":"LIRR riders can unmask once TSA ends rule, MTA chief says","teaserTitle":"Lieber: LIRR riders can unmask once TSA ends rule","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.d","title":"Long Island","path":"/long-island","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.LongIsland.Transportation.d","title":"Transportation","path":"/long-island/transportation","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/NDBlZjc0NDMtODZlMy00","title":"LIMTA220325","path":"/long-island/transportation/mask-mandate-lirr-x7r42nas","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/OWUzZTFhMTQtNjFkMC00","name":"Alfonso A.

In 2020, when the pandemic stifled sales for months but led to a summertime boom, that figure was 29.4% and not a single community had more than 50% of houses sell for above asking price.

It’s listed for $510,000 by Salvatore Di Puma, a real estate agent with Exit Realty Achieve in Smithtown, who showed the house to prospective buyers at an open house last weekend.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Tufano said she’s balancing her interest in making a deal quickly ahead of the family’s move to Virginia with getting the best price. “I don’t want to move fast and not get the best deal on the house either,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch3\u003e Rising prices \u003c/h3\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e While prices rose in all of the most competitive areas for buyers, they didn’t rise by as much as in other areas of the Island.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;The average increase in median sale price in those 36 hottest \u0026nbsp;communities in 2021 compared to the previous year was 7.8%. That compares with a 14.3% average increase for Long Island, excluding the East End. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Competition doesn’t always drive steep price increases, Miller noted. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I think there’s an assumption that the higher the bidding wars, the higher the price growth, and as we can see here, that’s not necessarily the same thing. If you have a market that has a higher bidding war share than another market, it doesn’t necessarily mean that prices are rising faster,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Maria Wilbur, a real estate agent with Keller Williams Realty in Garden City who frequently works with buyers and sellers in Suffolk County, said she tries to set realistic expectations. If a buyer can afford up to $425,000, she will often show homes priced around $400,000 with the expectation they will need to pay over asking price to make a deal. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Even with that strategy Wilbur said she recently had a day in which she had nine offers rejected across seven buyers. Bidding wars have led buyers to waive their right to an appraisal and a home inspection — a risky proposition that could speed up a deal but leave them on the hook for additional expenses. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I try to stay positive for them,” Wilbur said. “I let them know, ‘Look at all these people on the line. We’re not the only ones. Eventually it’s a numbers game. It’s a tough market.

They searched along the South Shore from Patchogue to Center Moriches for their first home. Mikelinich estimates they looked at 20 to 25 homes last winter, scheduling appointments after work and attending multiple open houses on Saturday and Sunday. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The first-time homebuyers faced plenty of rejection. Mikelinich said they put in offers on about half the homes they viewed, with all of them at or above asking price. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e After about a two-month search, Mikelinich and Lowe reached a deal on a home in East Patchogue listed for sale by owner and closed in July for $470,000, which was slightly above the asking price.

mandate, now get to work in the Big Apple and avoid the shots — a policy reversal that spares\u0026nbsp;a few from the fate of average workers who refused\u0026nbsp;to roll up their sleeves. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Mayor Eric Adams announced on Thursday that only professional athletes and performers qualify under a new exception\u0026nbsp;to the months-old, citywide mandate requiring nearly every other worker\u0026nbsp;to show proof of full vaccination. Critics, including labor unions,\u0026nbsp;say the exception is\u0026nbsp;unfair to those who lost their jobs\u0026nbsp;over their vaccination status.\u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Speaking at Citi Field in Queens, Adams said the exception would help the city’s economy, which has struggled to recover from the pandemic. He said the exception is also a matter of fairness, since the old rule made an exception for unvaccinated performers and athletes from out of town, but not for local performers and athletes. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “This is about putting New York City-based performers on a level playing field. Day One when I was mayor I looked at the rule that stated hometown players had an unfair disadvantage,” Adams said, adding: “Unimaginable. We were treating our performers differently because they lived and played for home teams. It's not acceptable.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Dr. Mitch Katz, head of the city's public health\u0026nbsp;care system, said he backs the new policy, saying of the old one: “I don't think it makes any sense or follows any particular science.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer said the new policy would apply not just to big stars, but also, say, to a jazz musician at a club in Flatbush or a stand-up comic at the Comedy Cellar in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In February, nearly 1,500 municipal workers were fired for refusing to show vaccine proof pursuant to a related mandate covering public-sector workers; there are still more yet who could be fired whose appeals are pending. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Adams, who had publicly mused for more than a month about changing the rules, said Thursday that fired municipal workers would not be rehired. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Michael Kane of Wantagh taught in the city public school system until October, when the mandate, imposed under then-Mayor Bill de Blasio went into effect. Kane, 43, has refused to get vaccinated and was officially fired in February. He’s had to tap savings. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;Performers, athletes — mostly rich people — don’t have to show proof of vaccination to do their jobs in New York City, and I’m pressing back on that: how come not for the little guy? How come not for teachers, firefighters, police officers, so many of us that are on unpaid leave or lost our jobs,” Kane said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In statements, labor unions of municipal workers said the exception provides ammunition for pending litigation challenging the mandate. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “If the mandate isn’t necessary for famous people, then it’s not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city,” said Patrick J. Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the union representing the rank-and-file. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Alison Gendar, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said in an email: “If the rules are going to be suspended, particularly for people with influence, then the UFT and other city unions are ready to discuss how exceptions could be applied to city workers.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e And Benny Boscio, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, the city’s biggest union for\u0026nbsp;correction officers, said: “Terminating our members based on a policy that no longer exists for most New Yorkers is both disparate treatment and counterproductive.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Correction officers have had among the municipal\u0026nbsp;workforce's\u0026nbsp;lowest vaccination rates. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e For months, the mandate — which went into effect Dec. 27 for private-sector workers and months earlier for the municipal workforce — meant that unvaccinated hometown players like Irving were banned from playing in games in New York City.\u003cbr /\u003e Irving has refused to be vaccinated, explaining in October on Instagram: “It’s not about being anti-vax … It's just really about being true to what feels good for me.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Irving, the team’s star point guard, had also been restricted from attending home games at Barclays Center because of an earlier mandate, instituted in August and since rescinded by Adams, that limited attendance at venues such as arenas, restaurants, bars and gyms, to those with proof of vaccination. That requirement was dropped earlier this month — and Irving attended games at Barclays this month but just as a spectator. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e On Thursday at Citi Field, Adams made the announcement flanked by executives from the Yankees, as well as the Mets. That team, at least as of last season, was among Major League Baseball's least vaccinated. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The applause had ended, and Sandy Alderson, the Mets president, and Randy Levine, his Yankees counterpart, were asked by a reporter about whether their non-player employees were fired for failure to get vaccinated. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Levine didn’t answer, but Alderson said that 99.5% of Mets employees complied with the mandate. “There were one or two cases that came up that people were not prepared to be vaccinated, and their situations, they were terminated.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u003cem\u003eWith Laura Albanese and Steve\u0026nbsp;Langford\u003c/em\u003e

He’d agreed to terms with the Giants after being cut by the Bills, joining a slew of Buffalo imports who had flocked to New Jersey, including general manager Joe Schoen, head coach Brian Daboll and offensive line coach Bobby Johnson. And he was excited to be coming to a team for which he could play center on the offensive line, a position he always felt suited him the best. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eBut it wasn’t until his flight landed at LaGuardia Airport on Wednesday and a car picked up Feliciano and his dad to drive them through New York City to the Giants’ facility in East Rutherford that it really dawned on him. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe tall buildings. The fast pace. The noise, the energy, the vibe. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I was surprised at how emotional I was getting,\" the 6-4, 325-pound Feliciano told Newsday of that experience. \"Things had been moving so fast the last week and I was anxious from being cut and trying to find a place to go, and things didn’t really click until I was in that car. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"Everything hit me and I was like ‘Damn, I’m home.’ \" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeliciano, 30, spent the first few years of his life on Long Island living in Hewlett. His parents divorced when he was only 3 and he moved to South Florida to live with his mother, Alicia, but his father, Rafael, remained here along with lots of other members of his two large extended families.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eFeliciano went all the way through school in Florida, but whenever there were breaks from that in the spring, the summer or around the holidays, he would come back to New York. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"My dad was living in Inwood at the time, so I was staying there or I would go see my grandparents in Hewlett,\" he said. \"I spent a lot of time around there.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe vividly remembers cutting through a neighbor's place with his younger brother, Christopher, to make their way to Lawrence Primary School No. 2. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"We would end up there playing basketball and handball for hours,\" he said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eLife wasn’t always as carefree and simple for Feliciano. He was born with a foot deformity that required braces for his first two years of life, and doctors were fairly certain he would never be able to run or play sports. His mother fought through two bouts of cancer while he was still living under her care. For a time during high school, he was homeless, relying on different friends with an open couch to take him in each night. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHis father would always ask him to come back to Long Island, Feliciano said, but he was \"obsessed\" with the idea of playing college football for the University of Miami. He wasn’t a big-time recruit and had to practically ambush a Miami coach to hand-deliver game film in order to even land on their radar, but in his heart, Feliciano said he knew he would have a much better chance of playing for the Hurricanes if he was in nearby Davie, Florida, and not all the way up in New York. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe did play at Miami — and even graduated with a degree in human resources management — which made him seem like a Floridian through and through. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eNew York, though, was always a big part of him. Sometimes it even bubbles up to the surface. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eIt did when he played for Miami offensive line coach Jeff Stoutland, a Staten Island native who eventually recruited him to the Hurricanes. And it did when he was drafted by the Raiders and his first NFL position coach was Mike Tice from Central Islip. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"I’m always around New Yorkers,\" he said. \"It’s good. We get each other.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe certainly felt like a New Yorker when the 2019 season started. It was his first year with the Bills, so technically he was in the state, but the first two games of that season were on the road against the Giants and Jets. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That was a dream come true,\" he said of those back-to-back games (and wins). \"What a way to start the season. That might have been the easiest camp I ever went through just because I was so excited to get to those two games. It was my first time playing there . . . I definitely get the feels when I play in MetLife.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe’ll get that a lot more often now. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eJust as he did this past week on the drive from LaGuardia. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThat car ride brought it all flooding back to him — a brief journey from Queens to Jersey that seemed to parallel the much longer one from his early childhood to that moment, from the braces on his feet, the basketball courts in Inwood and the family struggles of his adolescence all the way to the NFL for seven seasons and now, finally, with his true hometown team.\u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eHe thought about his family that still lives on Long Island, his aunts and uncles and cousins who were always mildly interested in football and his career but now are very excited to have him playing for the Giants. He thought about his Uncle Danny in Arizona, the lifelong Giants fan who would show up to his University of Miami games decked out in the blue of his favorite NFL team. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"He’s stoked,\" Feliciano said. \"Everyone else in my family is like ‘We’re all Giants fans now!’ And he’s like, ‘Yeah. Welcome. Been here for years.’ \" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eAnd he thought about the man sitting next to him in the back seat of the car. The father who always hoped his son would come back home to New York finally had gotten his wish (even though he now lives in Florida himself). \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"When I was growing up, I would wake up and my dad would already be at work,\" Feliciano said. \"He was an MTA bus driver in the city. He used to be the guy driving people around the city. And now he’s being chauffeured through the city by the New York Giants. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e\"That,\" he said, \"was meaningful.\" \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003eThe vantage point had changed, but Feliciano was relieved to know it all still felt like home. \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-19T21:07:42.365Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-19T21:07:42.365Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/giants-o75442","headline":"LI's Jon Feliciano: There's no place like home","teaserTitle":"LI's Feliciano: There's no place like home","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Football.d","title":"Football","path":"/sports/football","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Football.Giants.d","title":"Giants","path":"/sports/football/giants","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/article.1.50541179","title":"spGFEAT220320","path":"/sports/football/giants/giants-o75442","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/YmYyOGVhN2UtNTMyOS00","name":"Tom Rock","role":null,"imageUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:OGY2NTM1ZjgtZmJjMC00:N2Q1NmUz/image.jpg","authorUrl":"/author/tom-rock-pwx5y8dr","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tTom Rock began covering sports for Newsday in 1996 and has been the Giants beat writer since 2008.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","deactivated":false,"twitterId":"@TomRock_Newsday","tikTokId":"","instagramId":"","emailAddress":"tom.rock@newsday.com","__typename":"Author"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/image.1.50541180","width":0,"height":0,"title":"spGIANTS330217","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:NDA1ZGE0YjUtMjA0MS00:MDU3YmZl/spgiants330217.jpg","caption":"Buffalo Bills guard Jon Feliciano (76) blocks a defender in an NFL game against the Miami Dolphins, Sunday, Oct. 31, 2021 in Orchard Park, N.Y.

Federal legislators, too, are considering a break from the 18.4-cent federal gas tax, unchanged since 1993, and woefully inadequate to fund the nation’s roads. Were it indexed to inflation, as it should be, the tax would be 36 cents. Indexed to gas prices ($1.09 average at that time), it would be 72 cents. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Having kept it artificially low is enough of a break. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e A vacation from gas taxes is ill-advised. It won’t end inflation-induced pressures on consumers, because inflation is economy-wide. It won’t help non-drivers. Much of the money would go to people facing no financial difficulties. The policy itself would be inflationary, putting more disposable income in the system. And gas rebate-check proposals, also under discussion in Albany and Washington, wouldn’t be much better unless they could be precisely targeted to those in need. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Worse, such breaks could lure people to drive more by making gas cheaper, increasing demand and raising prices further. And there is no guarantee wholesalers and distributors who actually pay the tax would pass the savings on to gas station franchisees, or that stations would pass them on to consumers.So prices could stay the same or decline but a little, and the governments instituting tax holidays would still lose revenue. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Cheaper gas promotes bigger, less-efficient cars, delays the switch to electric vehicles, and decreases public transportation use. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In New York, a proposal to stop collecting gas taxes from May 1 until the end of 2022 is in the State Senate’s budget proposal, and Assembly Majority Leader Carl Heastie says he’s listening. The taxes - charged by the state, counties and municipalities and varying with gas prices - equal about 67.5 cents per gallon when gas is $4. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In March 1980, inflation hit 14.8%. There was no federal or New York gas-tax holiday. In July 2008, gasoline hit an all-time inflation-adjusted high of $5.25 a gallon. There was no federal or New York gas-tax holiday. And that was wise. In both cases, high prices and inflation ended with massive recessions. It’s unlikely the tax would have been reinstituted when unemployment exploded. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e There has never been a federal gas-tax holiday, and in short ones tried by Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Indiana since 2000, retailers mostly didn’t pass on all the intended savings. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Roads in disrepair cost New York drivers an average of $632 annually in repairs, depreciation and the like, according to a report by TRIP, a transportation research nonprofit.

The United States and Canada have already banned the import of Russian oil, although neither had been major buyers. But chances are that more countries will follow suit. All this means gasoline prices are likely to continue to climb. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Even before the U.S. ban, private traders were already voluntarily choosing not to deal in Russian oil, sending a shock through global markets. Russian contributions to oil markets may have dropped by some 2 million barrels a day, some analysts think. The exit of the U.S. oil services industry from Russia, already in progress, will also lead to production problems in Russia's oil sector in short order, given that the industry has relied on those companies for decades. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e As the Ukraine conflict drags on, the United States and its allies will need more oil from other sources, especially if more European countries join the ban. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has not yet proven itself up to the task of galvanizing the industry to increase supplies. Nor have U.S. oil companies risen to the occasion. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e When the captains of the U.S. oil industry met earlier this month in Houston for their annual convention, they offered multiple excuses why they couldn't do their part. \u0026quot;Now, with supply-chain challenges, it makes any attempt to grow now — and at a rapid pace — very, very difficult,\u0026quot; said Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum. Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield added that investors aren't pushing companies to boost production beyond their current plans. (\u0026quot;Nobody believes this problem is long-term,\u0026quot; he said — though it may well turn out to be.) ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said \u0026quot;poor regulatory policy\u0026quot; was partly to blame for lack of supply, and said high oil prices were a chance to pay down debt and improve shareholder returns. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e To be sure, the U.S. oil sector is constrained — as are many other industries — by supply chain issues and manpower shortages. New drilling requires steel pipe and other materials in short supply. Still, the lack of leadership and creative thinking on display is galling. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm got it right when she said on March 9 in Houston: \u0026quot;We are on a war footing — an emergency — and we have to responsibly increase short-term supply where we can right now to stabilize the market and to minimize harm to American families.\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Some Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., have suggested that the problem lies with the Biden administration, in part because it failed to issue more leases on federal lands. But that's not the problem. A careful analysis by the Associated Press in 2020 showed that some of the largest American onshore oil and gas producers, including Devon Energy and EOG Resources, stockpiled enough leases to drill \u0026quot;for years\u0026quot; without needing any additional federal leases. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e There is precedent for ambitious concerted action. In World War II, the federal government had a petroleum coordinator who guided distribution of raw materials to the oil sector. In addition, the U.S. Petroleum Administration for War helped restore a British oil field in the Sherwood Forest in England — a mission that involved the secret deployment of Oklahoma roughnecks. Using innovative methods, and despite a shortage drilling equipment, the venture, led by Tulsa based Noble Drilling, completed 94 new producing oil wells in one year, helping the British military stave off a fuel crisis. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e But most importantly, back home, the U.S. industry sprung into action to provide the fuel for D-Day. The federal government paid for the construction of a \u0026quot;War Emergency Pipeline,\u0026quot; stretching from Baytown, Texas, to Linden, New Jersey, completing it in just a year. The pipeline, coupled with the industry's wartime priority access to raw materials, enabled an extraordinary drilling campaign in the Permian Basin of Texas, a region that still provides much of U.S. oil production today; national oil production surged 30 percent during the war. The effort was organized by the U.S. government and a group of 72 American oil firms, called the Petroleum Industry War Council. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The current situation isn't equivalent to a world war, but even a fraction of the commitment to innovation and problem-solving on display in the 1940s would be welcome now. One option would be for the federal government to pre-purchase American oil from new domestic onshore wells — those not already planned or drilled. (Onshore drilling can provide new oil in a matter of months, whereas offshore sites can take years to bring online.) Such legal arrangements are common in global oil trade, where companies pay oil producers in advance, for product delivered later. The cost of the oil would be calculated based on formula for estimated prices at the time of delivery plus a negotiated interest rate — much the way the U.S. Department of Energy already buys and sells oil for the government-held stockpile known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The benefit of a pre-financed oil drilling deal is that the federal government would own the oil, and therefore would be able to address its best emergency use. (Such a plan might require authorization by, and funding from, Congress.) Depending on national priorities when the new oil arrives, it could be processed into fuel for military purposes, sent to Europe as a form of war-related aid — Europe is far more dependent on Russian oil than the United States — or released domestically to bring down gas prices and bolster the economy. The time to create such a mechanism is now, before a true energy emergency hits. Given massive shale resources in the Permian Basin and existing pipeline infrastructure, such a plan could add from 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day in a matter of months, if the raw materials needed were prioritized under war authorization to the sector. (America currently produces 11.6 million barrels a day.) Canada could do something similar. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Some environmentalists will balk at the idea of increasing oil production. But additional drilling to replace Russian oil would not add to global greenhouse gas emissions, because it would be replacing lost Russian production — and that country's oil fields are notorious methane-emitters. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e A federal project to encourage drilling would have multiple benefits. It would signal to energy markets that more oil is coming, potentially lowering prices today. It would allow President Biden to release a higher rate of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, another way to temporarily increase the domestic supply, confident that more oil was coming to replenish the reserve. Foreseeing lower prices, Middle East oil producers might ramp up their own exports to get their own oil into the market, grabbing income before U.S. producers can gear up. Finally, it would make it more plausible for Europe to institute a fuller ban on Russian oil imports. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e American oil industry leaders need to consider their place in history. They and American politicians alike have risen to meet daunting energy challenges in the past. Both groups will diminish themselves if they spend today's crisis trading accusations about regulatory policy and shareholder dividends rather than acting in the national interest. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u003cem\u003eAmy Myers Jaffe is a research professor at Tufts University's Fletcher School and author of \u0026quot;Energy's Digital Future.\u0026quot;\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T18:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T18:56:55.989Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/commentary/oil-prices-companies-eu-ban-russia-vfjm933w","headline":"Oil companies say they can't help lower prices.

Already, the two major vaccine makers have asked the Food and Drug Administration to sign off on another booster shot, recognizing that the vaccines' effectiveness wanes over time. All this talk has raised a depressing possibility: Will we all have to keep getting shots every few months forever into the future? \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The answer, thankfully, appears to be no. The evidence suggests that most people won't need a fourth dose. Immunocompromised people and the elderly, who are at risk of severe breakthrough infections, will probably need another shot — and may need to keep getting them until a more long-lasting vaccine is made available. But for most people, the immunity conferred by the first round of vaccines and natural infection will be enough to keep us safe. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e How can we be sure? We know that the vaccines generate antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, but that these antibodies can be less effective against new variants like omicron. Even if those antibodies are boosted with an extra shot, their effectiveness will wane several months later. Luckily, the vaccines also generate something called cellular immunity, which is longer-lasting, and protect against severe disease in a more enduring fashion. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Antibody-producing memory B cells — generated by the vaccines or as a result of a prior infection — have been shown to recognize the virus, including its variants. Although we do not know how long these memory B cells last, survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic were able to produce antibodies from memory B cells when their blood was exposed to the same strain nine decades later. The vaccines also trigger the production of T cells. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e While B cells serve as memory banks to produce antibodies when needed, T cells amplify the body's response to a virus and help recruit cells to attack the pathogen directly. Memory T cells generated by COVID-19 infection may last a lifetime, according to a study that examined participants with varying degrees of initial disease severity. Memory T cells generated in individuals who survived a different coronavirus infection in 2003 were shown in a recent paper to last at least 17 years. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e During the omicron variant surge this winter, we did see a greater chance of re-infection compared with previous variants — but not in severe disease across the general population. A study from Qatar showed that a history of natural infection protected against mild re-infection with previous variants 90% of the time, but that protection declined to 56% against omicron. Two vaccines protected against mild re-infection 89% of the time against the delta variant, but that protection declined to 36% against omicron in a Canadian study. This is probably because the omicron variant was able to evade antibodies. In both studies, however, protection against severe disease endured, probably mediated by cellular immunity. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The increase in antibodies from a vaccine boost may last only a short period, around four months, according to one study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But this boost will be necessary for certain groups to maintain protection against severe disease, including the immunocompromised, older people and those with multiple risk factors. This is because B cells typically take two to four days to make neutralizing antibodies, which may be too long to wait for those who are more susceptible to severe disease. In another recent CDC study, those who were severely immunocompromised (for instance, patients on B cell-depleting therapies or solid organ transplant recipients) and those older than 75 with four comorbidities were found to be susceptible to severe breakthrough infections. Immunocompromised individuals have already been approved for a fourth shot, and those who are older with other medical conditions should obviously be next in line. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e But there is little evidence that a fourth shot would be beneficial for the rest of the U.S. population. A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that a fourth shot in health care workers did not improve the effectiveness of the vaccine or reduce viral loads. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In the future, instead of using an mRNA or DNA vaccine that exposes us only to part of the virus (the spike protein, which is mutated across all the variants), we may need a vaccine booster that exposes us to the entire virus. Whole virus vaccines may be more protective against variants with multiple mutations in the spike protein. Vaccines given inside the nose can help boost antibodies at nasal surfaces, which will help with curbing viral transmission. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e For now, the vaccines we have are doing a good job of preventing severe illness in most people. Vulnerable people should start getting a fourth shot to shore up their defenses. For everyone else, though, it makes little sense to give more booster shots. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u003cem\u003eMonica Gandhi, an infectious-diseases specialist, is a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T15:54:19.446Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T18:55:45.373Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/opinion/commentary/covid-booster-vaccine-4th-shot-j0tae1i3","headline":"Yes, some people will need a fourth shot.

Gasoline was the first thing limited, but there was no gas shortage.

It said it confirmed readiness to execute precision strikes against North Korea’s missile launch points as well as command and support facilities. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the North's ICBM fired from the Sunan area near capital Pyongyang traveled 1,080 kilometers (670 miles) and reached a maximum altitude of over 6,200 kilometers (3,850 miles). The missile was apparently fired on high angle to avoid reaching the territorial waters of Japan. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Japan’s Deputy Defense Minister Makoto Oniki said flight details suggested a new type of ICBM. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “It’s an unforgivable recklessness. We resolutely condemn the act,” Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said after arriving in Belgium for the Group of Seven meetings. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The missile flew 71 minutes before possibly landing near Japanese territorial waters off the island of Hokkaido, said Tokyo’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. Japan may search for debris inside its exclusive economic zone to analyze the North’s technology, he said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Japan’s coast guard issued a warning to vessels in nearby waters, but there were no immediate reports of damage to boats or aircraft. A Japanese fisheries organizations released a statement denouncing the launch as a “barbaric act” that puts fishermen’s lives and livelihoods at risk. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e South Korean President Moon Jae-in during an emergency National Security Council meeting criticized North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for breaking a self-imposed moratorium on ICBM tests and posing a “serious threat” to the region and the broader international community. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The United States strongly condemns the North’s launch, said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, calling it a “brazen violation” of U.N.

That would place the entire U.S. mainland within striking distance. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Following a highly provocative streak in nuclear explosive and ICBM tests in 2017, Kim Jong Un suspended such testing in 2018 ahead of his first meeting with then-U.S. President Donald Trump. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e North Korea’s resumption of nuclear brinkmanship reflects a determination to cement its status as a nuclear power and wrest badly needed economic concessions from Washington and others from a position of strength, analysts say. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Kim may also feel a need to trumpet his military accomplishments to his domestic audience as he grapples with a broken economy worsened by pandemic border closures. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “Despite economic challenges and technical setbacks, the Kim regime is determined to advance its missile capabilities,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha Womans University. “It would be a mistake for international policymakers to think the North Korean missile threat can be put on the back burner while the world deals with the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The Biden administration’s passive handling of North Korea so far, while it focuses on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and an intensifying rivalry with China, is allowing more room for the North to dial up its testing activity, some experts say. The administration’s actions on North Korea have so far been limited to largely symbolic sanctions imposed over its recent tests and offers of open-ended talks that were rejected by Pyongyang. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e It was North Korea’s 12th round of weapons launches this year and came after it fired suspected artillery pieces into the sea on Sunday. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The North has also tested a variety of new missiles, including a purported hypersonic weapon and its first launch since 2017 of an intermediate range missile with a potential of reaching Guam, a key U.S. military hub in the Pacific. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e It also conducted two medium-range tests in recent weeks from Sunan, home to the country’s main airport, that the U.S. and South Korean militaries assessed to have involved components of the North’s largest ICBM. The allies had said the missile, which the North calls Hwasong-17, could be tested at full range soon. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Those tests were followed by another launch from Sunan last week. But South Korea’s military said the missile likely exploded shortly after liftoff. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e North Korea’s official media insisted that the two successful tests were aimed at developing cameras and other systems for a spy satellite. Analysts say the North is attempting to simultaneously advance its ICBMs and acquire some level of space-based reconnaissance capability under the pretense of a space launch to reduce international backlash to those moves. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e That launch may possibly come around a major political anniversary in April, the birthday of state founder Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current leader Kim. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The North’s previous ICBMs demonstrated potential range to reach the American homeland during three flight tests in 2017. The development of the larger Hwasong-17, which was first revealed in a military parade in October 2020, possibly indicates an aim to arm it with multiple warheads to overwhelm missile defenses. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In North Korea's last test of an ICBM in November 2017, the Hwasong-15 flew about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) for about 50 minutes at a maximum altitude of 4,000 kilometers (2,400 miles). It wasn’t immediately clear whether the missile from the latest test was the Hwasong-17. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Denuclearization talks with the U.S. have been stalled since 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korea’s demand for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Kim presided over a ruling Workers’ Party meeting on Jan. 19, where Politburo members issued a veiled threat to end his moratorium on ICBM and nuclear tests, citing U.S. hostility. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e South Korea’s military has also detected signs that North Korea was possibly restoring some of the tunnels at its nuclear testing ground that were detonated in May 2018, weeks ahead of Kim’s first meeting with Trump. \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T11:10:48.264Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T12:44:01.183Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/news/world/north-korea-missle-test-jefrovnl","headline":"Dialing up pressure, North Korea tests long-range missile","teaserTitle":"Dialing up pressure, North Korea tests long-range missile","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.d","title":"News","path":"/news","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.World.d","title":"World","path":"/news/world","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/M2I4MDZkMDQtODcwNy00","title":"WOKOREA220325","path":"/news/world/north-korea-missle-test-jefrovnl","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/ZDIzMjhmYWEtZDZlMS00","width":2100,"height":1399,"title":"Japan Korea Koreas Tensions","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:ZTVlMTJkNDktY2I4Ny00:ZTRlMDg3/japan-korea-koreas-tensions.jpeg","caption":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tA woman walks along a sidewalk past a TV displaying a news program on North Korea\u0026#39;s missile launch on Thursday\u0026nbsp;in Tokyo.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","altTag":"","byline":"","organization":"AP","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"useFreeform":false},"verticalMedia":null,"relatedLinks":[],"title":"WOKOREA220325"}},{"id":"contentid/Y2JkM2FiNmUtYmE0Ni00","__typename":"Teaser","title":"Ex-prosecutor: Trump 'guilty of numerous felony violations'","teaserOvertitle":null,"text":"A prosecutor who had been leading a criminal investigation into Donald Trump before quitting last month said in his resignation letter that he believes the former president is \"guilty of numerous felony violations\" and he disagreed with the Manhattan district attorney's decision not to seek an indictment.","longText":"","customLogo":null,"media":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/OTAyNTM0MDAtNjNkYy00","width":2100,"height":1400,"title":"USTRUMP220324_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:YTJlNTMwYjYtMTlmNC00:OGFmMzVj/ustrump220324_photos.jpeg","caption":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tAttorney Mark Pomerantz leaves court in New York on Sept. 8, 2004.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","altTag":"","byline":"MARY ALTAFFER","organization":"AP","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"useFreeform":false},"content":{"__typename":"Article","id":"contentid/Y2JkM2FiNmUtYmE0Ni00","lead":"A prosecutor who had been leading a criminal investigation into Donald Trump before quitting last month said in his resignation letter that he believes the former president is \"guilty of numerous felony violations\" and he disagreed with the Manhattan district attorney's decision not to seek an indictment.","body":"\u003cp\u003e A prosecutor who had been leading a criminal investigation into Donald Trump before quitting last month said in his resignation letter that he believes the former president is “guilty of numerous felony violations” and he disagreed with the Manhattan district attorney’s decision not to seek an indictment. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e In the letter, published Wednesday by The New York Times, Mark Pomerantz told District Attorney Alvin Bragg there was “evidence sufficient to establish Mr. Trump’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” of allegations he falsified financial statements to secure loans and burnish his image as a wealthy businessman. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “The team that has been investigating Mr. Trump harbors no doubt about whether he committed crimes — he did,” Pomerantz wrote. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Pomerantz and his former co-leader on the Trump probe, Carey Dunne, resigned on Feb. 23 after clashing with Bragg over the future of the case. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Both were top deputies tasked with running the investigation on a day-to-day basis.

But others celebrated the historic nature of her nomination.","body":"\u003cp\u003e WASHINGTON — Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on Wednesday evening emerged from two grueling days of confirmation hearings with scant Republican support but solid Democratic backing that’s expected to put her on the U.S. Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson, 51, the first Black woman and public defender chosen to be a justice, faced a Republican grilling that required her to explain her legal defense of Guantanamo detainees, her views on critical race theory\u0026nbsp;and her sentencing decisions in child pornography and drug cases. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e And Republicans made the two days of questioning rougher than many observers had anticipated. “This is a tough place,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) told her. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Some Republicans raised their voices and expressed anger, notably Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who stalked out of the hearing after a heated exchange. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson answered one big question: If confirmed, she said she won’t hear a case in the next term about the affirmative action program at Harvard, where she sits on the board of governors. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e But she ducked another: She declined to say if she opposes a proposal to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Here are five takeaways from the hearings. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e An elusive philosophy \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Senators often try to guess how nominees would rule once on the court by asking them about their judicial philosophy. But Jackson said she had no judicial philosophy, only a judicial methodology. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I have developed a methodology that I use in order to ensure that I am ruling impartially and that I am adhering to the limits on my judicial authority,” she said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Yet Jackson also echoed an approach used by conservative justices: “I believe that the Constitution is fixed in its meaning. I believe that it's appropriate to look at the original intent, original public meaning, of the words.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Democrats expressed no alarm, but some conservatives expressed surprise — and disbelief. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Senators had different reactions to her lack of a philosophy. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Graham and\u0026nbsp;Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called her an “activist.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) said philosophy doesn’t matter. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and\u0026nbsp;Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) seemed unsure of what to think. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Feinstein\u0026nbsp;said she’d been waiting for 15 hours for an answer on what kind of justice she would be — so she asked her. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson answered. “I've been saying stay in my lane, to not exert my authority beyond what the Constitution requires when I'm interpreting and applying the law.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e Soft on child porn crimes? \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Hawley led Republicans in the most provocative attack on Jackson’s 8-year record and 578 opinions as a D.C. Federal District Court judge by criticizing her for giving shorter sentences than guidelines and laws recommended in seven child pornography cases. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e She defended her use of several factors, including probation reports, and said the sentences fell within the usual range nationally. Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said 70% of child porn sentences nationally are lower than the guidelines. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Republicans repeatedly pointed to a 2013 case in which Jackson sentenced a 19-year-old in a plea agreement for two dozen child porn images on his laptop to serve three months, though prosecutors sought 24 months and guidelines recommended 97 to 121 months. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “All of the offenses are horrible,” she said, but added that even the government “in this case and in others has asked for a sentence that is substantially less than the guideline penalty.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e At least one Republican shrugged. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told the Washington Post: “There is no ‘there’ there.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e CRT criticism \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Cruz, a Harvard Law classmate of Jackson’s, charged that she\u0026nbsp;supports critical race theory, a controversial concept that racism is embedded in legal systems and policies. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson, he said, mentioned Nickole Hannah-Jones’ 1619 Project, which emphasizes the theory. Cruz then attacked books on critical race theory in the curriculum of Georgetown Day School, a private school where Jackson's\u0026nbsp;daughter goes and where she sits on the board. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “One portion of the book says babies are taught to be racist or anti-racist,\u0026quot; Cruz said. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson replied that she didn’t endorse the 1619 Project and that the school board has no control of the curriculum. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e She added, “It doesn’t come up in my work as a judge. It’s never something that I've studied or relied on, and it wouldn’t be something that I would rely on if I was on the Supreme Court.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e War crimes \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson appeared surprised by the question. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “You've been gracious and charming. Why in the world would you call Secretary of Defense [Donald] Rumsfeld and [President] George W. Bush war criminals in a legal filing? It seems so out of character for you,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I don't remember that particular reference. I was representing my clients in making arguments,” said Jackson, who as a public defender represented Guantanamo enemy combatants. “I did not intend to disparage the president or the secretary of Defense.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Jackson filed a habeas brief that argued the government's use of torture may “constitute war crimes” under the Alien Tort Statute and named Bush and Rumsfeld in their official capacities — and then updated the brief to name Barack Obama when he became president. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;Public defenders don't choose their clients and yet they have to provide vigorous advocacy,” Jackson said. “That's the duty of a lawyer.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003ch2\u003e Celebration \u003c/h2\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Several senators hailed Jackson’s nomination to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, though Graham scolded Democrats for filibustering Bush’s nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the D.C. Circuit Court, which\u0026nbsp;prevented her the chance of becoming the first. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Still, a sense of pending celebration filled the back of the room among the lawmakers, civil rights activists and others who came to see history made. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “We are on the precipice of shattering another ceiling, another glass ceiling. It's a sign that we as a country are continuing to rise to our collective cherished highest ideals,” said Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), one of three Black senators, on Monday. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I just feel this sense of overwhelming joy as I see you sitting there,” he said. \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-23T23:10:05.324Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T00:23:48.588Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-hearing-d8gly824","headline":"5 takeaways from Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court hearing","teaserTitle":"5 takeaways from Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court hearing","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.d","title":"News","path":"/news","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.News.Nation.d","title":"Nation/World","path":"/news/nation","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/YzhiZjdjYTktMjBkNS00","title":"USTAKE220324OWBI","path":"/news/nation/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-hearing-d8gly824","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/OWRiMjE3ZjMtODRkMy00","name":"Tom Brune","role":null,"imageUrl":"","authorUrl":"/author/tom-brune-rutwhq3e","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tTom Brune covers the White House, Congress, the Supreme Court and the federal government from Washington, D.C.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","deactivated":false,"twitterId":"@TomBruneDC","tikTokId":"","instagramId":"","emailAddress":"tom.brune@newsday.com","__typename":"Author"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/Mzk1NzdjMWUtZjI1ZC00","width":2100,"height":1377,"title":"USJACKSON220324_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:YTgyYTc1YTktMmU2Ny00:NjgwZTFk/usjackson220324_photos.","caption":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tSupreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson\u0026nbsp;speaks during the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing Wednesday.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\n\t\u0026nbsp;\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","altTag":"","byline":"Julia Nikhinson","organization":"Bloomberg","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"useFreeform":false},"verticalMedia":null,"relatedLinks":[],"title":"USTAKE220324OWBI"}}],"__typename":"Teasers"},"__typename":"Slot"},{"id":"contentid/OWM3ODI3ZjMtNWE2OS00","name":"Newsday Live","externalName":"homepage.NewsdayLive","headline":"Newsday Live","hidden":false,"link":{"hidden":false,"label":null,"url":"https://www.newsday.com/newsday-live","content":null,"__typename":"Link"},"layout":"basic4","numberItems":null,"module_blurb":null,"slotLabel":null,"style":"SEC","customimage":null,"imageAltTag":null,"bgColor":null,"cssData":null,"cssClass":null,"teasers":{"totalCount":4,"teasers":[{"id":"contentid/Y2NkNzk4OGQtMDZmNC00","__typename":"Teaser","title":"Summer camps: What you need to know","teaserOvertitle":null,"text":"What's new for 2022?

in free agency and was forced from his team’s loss after two periods as a precaution after a hard collision with Oliver Wahlstrom. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Brock Nelson scored twice, leaving him one shy of his first 30-goal season, Ilya Sorokin made 37 saves and Anthony Beauvillier scored the second- fastest goal to start a game in team history as the Islanders built a four-goal lead and won, 5-2, on Thursday night at UBS Arena. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I was able to just poke it and Beau finished it really well,” said Anders Lee, who had the first of his three assists as his forecheck forced defenseman Filip Hornek into a turnover before feeding Beauvillier in the low slot for a 1-0 lead just nine seconds in. “We set out to have a good start and we got a break to do it.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Bryan Trottier scored in five seconds in Boston on March 22, 1984. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The Islanders (28-25-9), who have won two straight and are on a 7-1-1 run, sit 15 points out of a playoff spot. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Greiss, who allowed three goals on 16 shots, played a memorable five seasons for the Islanders from 2015-20. He signed a two-year, $7.2 million deal with the Red Wings in 2020 as the Islanders made roster space for Sorokin. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “Greisser was a great teammate,” Mathew Barzal said. “He was a really fun guy.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The crowd gave Greiss a loud ovation during a first-period video tribute, which the goalie acknowledged by waving his glove. Greiss’ wife, Brittney, on social media, said she didn’t come to UBS Arena because “I would be an emotional wreck.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Wahlstrom made it 2-0 at 16:07 of the first but was penalized five seconds later. That turned into a five-on-three power play for the Red Wings (26-31-7), who failed to score. Sorokin made four saves during that 1:41. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Said coach Barry Trotz, “The whole game was teetering on that five-on-three and we did an outstanding job.” \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-25T02:06:32.225Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-25T03:39:22.212Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/hockey/islanders/islanders-red-wings-thomas-greiss-ilya-sorokin-jdvr04y8","headline":"Islanders beat former teammate Greiss and Red Wings","teaserTitle":"Islanders beat former teammate Greiss, Red Wings","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Hockey.d","title":"Hockey","path":"/sports/hockey","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Hockey.Islanders.d","title":"Islanders","path":"/sports/hockey/islanders","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/YjBjMjQ2ODYtZDllNy00","title":"SPIGAME220325","path":"/sports/hockey/islanders/islanders-red-wings-thomas-greiss-ilya-sorokin-jdvr04y8","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/NTgzNzUxOGItNWY3OC00","name":"Andrew Gross","role":null,"imageUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:YjcwMDMyNWYtMTNjNi00:NzgzMGI2/image.jpg","authorUrl":"/author/andrew-gross-yel7hi6f","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tAndrew Gross joined Newsday in 2018 to cover the Islanders.

But the Nets, whose next game at Barclays Center is Sunday night, deferred comment until Friday. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLevine and Mets president Sandy Alderson were among those who sat alongside the mayor as he made his announcement in front of the oversized number “42” in the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The mayor’s decision today makes things easier for us,” Alderson said after the news conference. “There’s no question about that. At the same time, we’re going to continue to attempt to get our players fully vaccinated.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not clear precisely how many Yankees and Mets are unvaccinated. Levine and Alderson said they were unable to provide a percentage because of MLB’s collective bargaining agreement. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy changing course, Adams avoided the spectacle of prominent Yankees and Mets sitting out the teams’ home openers and beyond. The Yankees will open the season at home against the Red Sox on April 7 and the Mets’ home opener is eight days later against the Diamondbacks. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that many city workers lost their jobs over a refusal to get vaccinated, Adams knew he would get criticized for making an exception for athletes and other performers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut he argued that the protocol that allowed unvaccinated visiting players to compete but not home players was unfair and not supported by science. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also said that given New York’s difficult economic situation two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, winning teams are important to attracting business activity, from arena workers to tourism to bars and restaurants. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By putting our home teams on an equal playing field, we increase their chances of winning, and that has a real impact on our city,” Adams said. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, a deep playoff run by Irving and the Nets would help businesses in and around Barclays Center. But in the short term, the Mets and Yankees would have played on regardless of whether rosters were whole. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStill, Alderson agreed with the mayor’s reasoning. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Star players attract more people to the ballpark,” he said, “so I do believe that were we to play with a less-than-full complement of players, it would have an impact on the number of people who would come to the ballpark” and thus on overall business activity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIrving still is ineligible to play in Canada and thus would miss a potential Nets play-in tournament game in Toronto. And the unvaccinated Yankees cannot play when the team visits the Blue Jays in early May. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We hope to get everybody vaccinated, but that’s a problem,” Levine said of the Toronto situation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen a reporter asked Levine about Aaron Judge’s “wishy-washy” comments on whether he has been vaccinated, Levine said it is up to Judge how he handles such questions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We stand behind vaccinations [as an organization],” Levine said. “What Aaron Judge does and how he speaks is up to Aaron Judge.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven Irving’s saga and the fact that Adams recently signaled he was in no rush to change course, many assumed one or both baseball teams played a role in getting him to act before Opening Day. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdams denied that, as did Levine. “We don’t lobby anything,” Levine said. “We talked to the mayor’s people. We gave them our point of view.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mets are believed to have more unvaccinated players than do the Yankees. Asked if he had been concerned about not having those players at home, Alderson said, “When you have a 26- or 28-man roster going into the season and a number of those players can’t play, there’s no question it has an impact.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Nets did not comment, the NBA and its players association issued a statement noting the league’s high vaccination and booster rates, then added: “With today’s announcement, we support the Mayor’s determination that the old rules treating hometown and visiting players differently no longer made sense, particularly because unvaccinated NBA players will continue to test daily.” \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T20:45:17.281Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-25T02:03:28.572Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/kyrie-irving-yankees-mets-nyc-vaccine-mandate-t139dirq","headline":"Mets, Yankees applaud mayor's decision to level playing field","teaserTitle":"Mets, Yanks applaud mayor's decision to level playing field","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/YjQyMTU2Y2UtNGExNy00","title":"SPVAX220325","path":"/sports/kyrie-irving-yankees-mets-nyc-vaccine-mandate-t139dirq","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/NzhhNjMwYjAtZmJhYS00","name":"Neil Best","role":null,"imageUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:NTcxZmY5ZjktN2ZlNi00:OGNmMGEx/image.jpg","authorUrl":"/author/neil-best-rk6vup24","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tNeil Best first worked at Newsday in 1982, returned in 1985 after a detour to Alaska and has been here since, specializing in high schools, college basketball, the NFL and most recently sports media and business.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","deactivated":false,"twitterId":"@sportswatch","tikTokId":"","instagramId":"","emailAddress":"neil.best@newsday.com","__typename":"Author"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/ZmYwNWZmN2ItZDE1Ni00","width":2100,"height":1216,"title":"nyVAX220325_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:ZDdlYjM0NzUtYTRmYy00:ZmQzZjg5/nyvax220325_photos.jpg","caption":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tMets president of Baseball operations, Sandy Alderson, introuduces Mayor Eric Adams, and Deputy Mayor Maria Torres-Springer, during a press announcement at Citi Field.

Barring injuries during the rest of\u0026nbsp;spring training, the quintet will be Cole, Luis Severino, Jameson Taillon, Jordan Montgomery and Nestor Cortes. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e But after that, there is a list of unproven pitchers. \u0026nbsp; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Clarke Schmidt, who allowed two hits and struck out three in two scoreless innings\u0026nbsp;in Thursday’s 5-3 loss to the Tigers at Publix Field, is among the group, which includes Deivi Garcia, Michael King, Luis Gil and JP Sears, to name a handful. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Schmidt is among the more interesting cases. The righthander came to the Yankees five years ago as a touted prospect after being \u0026nbsp;taken 16th overall\u0026nbsp;in the first round of the 2017 draft. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e He entered last spring training poised to compete for a rotation spot,\u0026nbsp;or\u0026nbsp;at the very least\u0026nbsp;put himself in contention for a bullpen spot or to be among the first called up when an injury occurred. But he suffered a right elbow strain early in camp, well before the exhibition\u0026nbsp;games started, and it all but sabotaged his season. He\u0026nbsp;appeared in only\u0026nbsp;two regular-season games. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “It was really tough,” said Schmidt, who in the past has battled command issues. “I feel healthy, and today was a product of that.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Schmidt, 26, could leave camp with the big-league team as a bullpen arm – especially with the rosters expanded to 28 through May 1 and the Yankees planning to take 15 pitchers – but if general manager Brian Cashman is unsuccessful in his ongoing efforts to get a rotation upgrade, he\u0026nbsp;is likely to be on standby with Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “We’ve all seen it before,” Schmidt said. “It’s very, very rare you see a season where [a team]\u0026nbsp;uses just five starters. We all know how the season works and how baseball works. It’s 162 games, so at some point, your name’s going to get called.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The most intriguing of the aforementioned names is Garcia. The 5-9 righthander, who will turn\u0026nbsp;23 on May 19, showed glimpses in 2020 of the star the Yankees projected him to be when they signed him at the age of 16 out of the Dominican Republic in 2015. But despite Garcia’s success in the minors\u0026nbsp;and briefly in the majors\u0026nbsp;as primarily a fastball-curveball pitcher, the Yankees decided the latter pitch wasn’t good enough and had him incorporate a slider that hasn’t yet taken. Garcia went\u0026nbsp; 3-7 with a 6.85 ERA in the minors last season and,\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tin the words of one rival evaluator, looked like “a complete mess.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e If\u0026nbsp;Garcia – or Gil, King, Schmidt, etc. – can take that next step, it will go a long way toward answering the questions surrounding just how much depth the Yankees have when they face the injuries every major league staff has to deal with. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e “I do believe one of the strengths of our organization is some of the pitching we have at the higher levels now, whether it’s guys on the roster or even guys not on the roster that I feel like could factor in in a number of roles, whether it’s out of the pen or even in a starting situation,” Aaron Boone said. “I do feel good about that depth.” \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-24T23:48:14.118Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-25T00:20:17.739Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-rotation-dkr2akxu","headline":"Yankees' rotation not bad, but does team have enough depth? ","teaserTitle":"Yanks' rotation is OK, but what about the depth? ","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.d","title":"Sports","path":"/sports","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Baseball.d","title":"Baseball","path":"/sports/baseball","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Sports.Baseball.Yankees.d","title":"Yankees","path":"/sports/baseball/yankees","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/NTA4ODAwMjAtZWU2MS00","title":"SPYANKS220325","path":"/sports/baseball/yankees/yankees-rotation-dkr2akxu","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/YzAwODZkODYtODM1Ni00","name":"Erik Boland","role":null,"imageUrl":"","authorUrl":"/author/erik-boland-tmadonqq","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tErik Boland started in Newsday\u0026#39;s sports department in 2002.

In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant is also offering its original 1980 menu, at 1980 prices. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Carlo Lubrano, whose father, Pasquale, founded the restaurant, said that the “rollback” tradition began in 2010 when “my brothers and I were thinking about how to celebrate that we’d been in business for 30 years. We wanted to do something to honor Dad\u0026nbsp;and say ‘Thank you’ to our customers. So we went back to the exact menu Dad had created.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The most expensive item from the old menu is a veal chop ($18.75), either alla Marsala or “alla Bussola,” which means it comes smothered in mushrooms, onions and peppers. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e With the exception of a handful of current Italian standards (fried calamari, penne alla vodka, anything drizzled with balsamic vinegar), La Bussola’s 1980 menu fits right into 2022: Baked clams ($4.95), prosciutto and melon ($3.75), veal Francese ($9.75), chicken Parmigiana ($8) chicken cacciatore ($9), mussels Posillipo ($8), spaghetti carbonara and tortellini alla panna (both $8). \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Almost everything on the old menu has been retained on the current one, but one visitor from the Reagan era is veal bechamela ($9.50), scaloppine that has been coated in cream sauce before being dredged in breadcrumbs and sauteed. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Carlo explained how La Bussola’s menu has evolved over the years: “Back when my father was working at Stella restaurant in Forest Hills and even when he opened in Glen Cove, high-end Italian restaurants would serve spaghetti and meat sauce, lasagna.

Huntington is Tadross’ newest location and biggest yet, but all share a common aesthetic: A fun, vibrant one. The store’s overall design lends itself to Instagram, from its walls that are decked out with glitzy decals, rainbows and dripping ice cream to the sprinkle-embellished counter. The Instagram-obsessed could easily lose track of time: Pose for photos in front of its doughnut props that cascade from the ceiling, or by the oversized upside down ice cream cone. During the day, it’s \u0026quot;super bright\u0026quot; Tadross said, but once the sun goes down, the disco lights go on \u0026quot;for more of a club kind of feel.\u0026quot; Lighting up the space is also a neon \u0026quot;Donut grow up\u0026quot; sign.

The food is, to a dish, ready for its close-up, but so are the drinks, from elegant, Japanese-inspired cocktails to the playful \u0026quot;jasmine,\u0026quot; a blend of gin, brandy, jasmine, lemon, salted plum and bubbles served in a smiling ceramic kitty. Bakuto’s walls are aswirl with images based on the elaborate tattoos of bygone Japanese gamblers, the so-called bakuto.

Many of its cocktails and grub come adorned with a small rubber duck, but that’s not the only noteworthy attribute here. Where large TVs aren’t taking up wall space, all things duck-related are, including an illuminated \u0026quot;Shake your tail feather\u0026quot; sign; wall art comprised of more than 500 rubber duckies; and an oversized,\u0026nbsp;\u0026quot;cheeky\u0026quot; panel that features the backside of a duck, giving the impression it’s hit a wall.

During the early days of the pandemic, co-owner Brad Wilson scoured the area for '70s and '80s memorabilia to adorn this retro-themed spot.

That way, people could tell from a distance whether the new pub-style spot was open. But Instagram had other ideas, and thus the neon TR (visible from the front window and glowing beautifully during the wee hours) is illuminated 24/7. Home to Canterbury's for decades until the pandemic, Teddy's owners added a cozy fireplace that's also camera-ready, and a few yards from that, a makeshift stage, which plays host to musicians most nights.

Very, Alex Fiorentino would argue, taking our collective post-pandemic temperature. “People are dying to have fun,” insisted the 41-year-old owner of Casarecce, a new Italian spot in Bellmore. “We want so much to go back to the life that we had previously.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e No argument there, but what kind of fun are we talking, exactly? Chuck E. Cheese traffics in fun. So does Dave \u0026amp; Buster’s. You will be relieved to hear that Casarecce’s idea of fun is its own, except perhaps in the audacity of its design. One wall showcases vintage-looking mirrors of varying dimensions, a second screams “amore” in cursive pink neon, a third features geometric shapes and 27 shades of paint.   The design was Fiorentino’s. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;I wanted it to look a little bit gaudy and ostentatious.

In an attempt “to stay relevant” during the pandemic, the pair held virtual aperitivo hours on Zoom et al., sampling wines chosen by Fiorentino and charcuterie boards created by Miranda to the accompaniment of 30 or 40 Meritage fans who’d pre-purchased them. “It was a blast,” said Fiorentino of the popular weekly event, “and really turned the corner for us in terms of becoming a restaurant for the neighborhood.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Whereas Meritage’s menu is pan-Mediterranean, Casarecce’s attempts to showcase Miranda’s classical training in Italian cuisine, and he does not disappoint. Housemade pastas are a highlight, naturally, and Miranda’s cacio e pepe (emphasis on the pepe) is a luscious winner ($22/$33), but so is the obligatory veal chop Parmesan, a bone-in, 16-ounce portion butterflied, pounded, and barely contained by the dinner plate, an entree by turns mouthwatering and monumental ($38). Meltingly good pink medallions of beef tenderloin are paired with polenta and roasted cauliflower ($26), while perfectly seared scallops line up like steppingstones over a creamy Parmesan risotto ($26). \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Not fun enough for you?

A tight menu of Chinese-American classics is prepared here without woks or fryolators, and if the greaseless egg rolls are stuffed with mushrooms and leeks and served with sriracha aioli, if the “popcorn” wontons are crisped and browned in an air fryer, if the “Kung Wow” chicken lacks any hint of glop — they are all recognizably good, old Chinese takeout. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e While authentic, regional Chinese cuisine is taking hold all over Nassau and Suffolk, Mogu founder Mike Wang noted that traditional mom-and-pop Chinese takeouts are under threat. Among the challenges they face are the physical challenge of cooking everything in screaming-hot oil in a heavy wok and, most of all, a profound labor shortage. \u0026quot;Cooking in a wok requires tremendous skill,\u0026quot; he explained when the first Mogu, in Farmingdale, opened in 2020. \u0026quot;With fewer people coming here from China, and very few children of Chinese immigrants interested in doing this — it’s increasingly difficult to find people who know how to cook this way.\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Wang was born in China but grew up in his parent’s Chinese takeout restaurant, Jen’s, first on Conklin Street in Farmingdale and then on Hicksville Road in Massapequa, where it still thrives. He fulfilled his parents’ dream by attaining a doctorate from an Ivy League university, but found himself drawn back to their business. Taking over the restaurant wasn’t an option — for all his degrees, he lacked the skills — but it pained him that \u0026quot;when they retire, their legacy will disappear.\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e And so, working with his mother, Jen Li, and MIT engineers, Wang came up with an \u0026quot;automatic wok-cooking platform\u0026quot; (SAM: \u0026quot;Smart Automatic Master Chef\u0026quot;) whose blade mimics the flipping action of an expertly wielded wok and whose superheated surface can sense the ingredients as they cook. Each dish has its own algorithm and \u0026quot;cooks\u0026quot; need only add the requisite ingredients (which are precut and apportioned in another Mogu facility) and SAM does the rest. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Since Mogu opened in Farmingdale, Wang, Li and their partners, Pat Spates (co-owner of SeaQua Deli in Massapequa, St. James and Patchogue) and Ben LoManto (of\u0026nbsp;Vespa Italian Chophouse in Northport\u0026nbsp;and Vespa Italian Kitchen \u0026amp; Bar and Harleys American Grille in Farmingdale) have been plotting their next move. During the worst of the pandemic, the Route 110 location — smack dab in the midst of a lot of businesses whose employees were working from home — generated less of a lunch crowd than had been anticipated. But third-party services delivered takeout far and wide. “We had a lot of customers coming to us all the way from Commack,” Wang said. Data from the third-party delivery services confirmed that Commack could use its own Mogu. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The Commack store has a larger kitchen and smaller seating area than Farmingdale, but the d\u0026eacute;cor is the same jaunty blend of warm wood and leafy greens. Some of the dishes added to the original menu include dumplings (pork, vegetable and spicy “Impossible” beef), seared Brussels sprouts, mei fun (thin rice) noodles with a choice of protein (or, in the Singapore style, with curry sauce) and cold sesame noodles. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e The Commack store also debuted a new feature: a self-serve kiosk that’s an alternative to ordering at the counter. Wang is working on an app as well as a completely self-serve store. The next generation of SAM (double-decker!) is also in the works.The Mogu team plans to open locations in Hauppauge (June), Woodbury (October) and Melville (2023). They also operate a Mogu with an abbreviated menu at UBS Arena in Elmont. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Does Wang foresee a day when Mogu is fully automated? Not a chance. “In the end, it’s all about a balance between technology and food,” he said. “You don’t want to lose the soul to the machine, you want to use the machine to bring out the soul of the food.” \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u003cem\u003eMogu Modern Chinese Kitchen is at 6228 Jericho Tpke., Commack;\u0026nbsp;631-257-3832,\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://moguchinese.com/\"\u003emoguchinese.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e","publishedDate":"2022-03-23T10:00:00Z","updatedDate":"2022-03-24T13:20:20.192Z","url":"https://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/restaurants/mogu-modern-chinese-kitchen-commack-yj7h5p9m","headline":"Mogu Modern Chinese Kitchen opens second location, in Commack","teaserTitle":"Inventive Chinese takeout spot opens new location","newsLabel":"none","newsLabel2":"none","subType":"article","contentPath":[{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Lifestyle.d","title":"Things to Do","path":"/lifestyle","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/Newsday.Lifestyle.Restaurants.d","title":"FeedMe","path":"/lifestyle/restaurants","__typename":"Section"},{"id":"contentid/ZTIyMTBiNzUtMGMzNS00","title":"FDFMMOGU220318","path":"/lifestyle/restaurants/mogu-modern-chinese-kitchen-commack-yj7h5p9m","__typename":"Article"}],"authors":[{"id":"contentid/M2ExYTUzYjItNmU2My00","name":"Erica Marcus","role":null,"imageUrl":"","authorUrl":"/author/erica-marcus-u7ku39mp","authorPage":"","authorBio":"\u003cp\u003e\n\tErica Marcus, a passionate but skeptical omnivore, has been reporting and opining on the Long Island food scene since 1998.\n\u003c/p\u003e\n","deactivated":false,"twitterId":"Erica_Marcus","tikTokId":"","instagramId":"","emailAddress":"erica.marcus@newsday.com","__typename":"Author"}],"topElement":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/NmI2ODAyODUtOGU4Zi00","width":2100,"height":1575,"title":"FDFMMOGU220318_photos","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:OWEzYzhiNTAtYzAwNi00:OWIzN2I1/fdfmmogu220318_photos.","caption":"\u003cp\u003eMei fun noodles with shrimp at Mogu Modern Chinese Kitchen in Commack.\u003c/p\u003e\n","altTag":"","byline":"Erica Marcus","organization":"Newsday","floatLeft":false,"floatRight":false,"useFreeform":false},"verticalMedia":null,"relatedLinks":[],"title":"FDFMMOGU220318"}}],"__typename":"Teasers"},"__typename":"Slot"},{"id":"contentid/NzgzZjExYTYtMmU2ZC00","name":"HS Sports","externalName":"homepage.hsSports","headline":"High School Sports","hidden":false,"link":{"hidden":false,"label":"High School","url":"/sports/high-school","content":null,"__typename":"Link"},"layout":"basic1","numberItems":"","module_blurb":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://scores.newsday.com/sports/highschool\"\u003eScores\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","slotLabel":"","style":"SEC","customimage":"","imageAltTag":"","bgColor":"","cssData":"","cssClass":"","teasers":{"totalCount":1,"teasers":[{"id":"contentid/article.1.50541623","__typename":"Teaser","title":"Top 25 boys track and field athletes for 2022","teaserOvertitle":null,"text":"A look at the top athletes coming into the spring outdoor season.","longText":"","customLogo":null,"media":{"__typename":"Image","id":"contentid/image.1.50528455","width":0,"height":0,"title":"skBTRACK220306_gallery","headline":"","baseUrl":"https://api.newsday.atexcloud.io/image-service/version/c:NjZjYzUxMmItNmIyZS00:MmU0ZjY0/skbtrack220306_gallery.jpg","caption":"Ryan John of Valley Stream North finished 2nd. in the boys long jump with a mark of 21' 10 at the 2022 NYSPHSAA Indoor Track \u0026amp; Field Championship held at Ocean Breeze Athletic Complex, Staten Island on Sat.

The family moved to their Lake Grove house two years ago, four years after founding the nonprofit Baskets of Hope in South Huntington in 2016. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;It was an unfinished basement,\u0026quot; explains Oliphant, 46, in a separate call. \u0026quot;A concrete-slab open-floor plan, insulation in the ceilings, cold in the winter, hot in the summer. It's like any basement. But that was the space she had in which to do Baskets of Hope,\u0026quot; which has provided some 1,700 care packages nationwide. \u0026quot;It's never stopped her,\u0026quot; he notes. \u0026quot;A bare basement's not going to stop Brit, that's for sure. Nothing deters her from getting the job done.\u0026quot; \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Down syndrome, affecting 1 in 700 live births in the United States, is caused by an extra chromosome 21, resulting in a similar set of physical traits but wide-ranging cognitive disabilities, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Global Down Syndrome Foundation says the majority of children with Down can learn to read and write and attend high school, and some even go on to postsecondary education. Brittany Schiavone graduated from Walt Whitman High in Huntington Station, and has taken classes taught by the Greenlawn-based Positive Community Connections on the Stony Brook University campus. \u0026nbsp;She works part-time at Party City in Islip. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e Oliphant and his team, anchored by Chasity Centeno of Northport's Riese Design and Josh Klinger of Coram's Klinger Construction, finished the basement with Sheetrock, new lights, an HVAC system and other upgrades. \u0026quot;We created an office space for Brittany\u0026nbsp;in which she can do her social-media stuff and communicate with families over Zoom,\u0026quot; Oliphant says. \u0026quot;We also were able to create a packing area for Baskets of Hope,\u0026quot; plus storage space for the donated books, blankets, toys and other things the baskets include. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e As well, \u0026quot;She's a huge fan of music and dancing, so we put a bunch of speakers in there. We made it very vibrant and bright and we gave her a hangout space\u0026quot; for a modicum of independence from family. The renovation took from July to October, when the show did the reveal seen in the episode. \u003c/p\u003e \n\u003cp\u003e \u0026quot;People with Down syndrome can do anything — really, really anything,\u0026quot; Brittany Schiavone — who has been a competitive modern dancer and makes appearances on TV-news programs — says as her mantra.
