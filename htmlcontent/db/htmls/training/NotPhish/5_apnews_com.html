Officials have said, and continue to maintain, that most of the refugees want to remain in Europe because they have family there and can more easily return home once it's safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHO IS COMING, WHEN AND WHERE WILL THEY GO?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the first Ukrainians refugee coming to the U.S. will be those who have family already in the United States, Biden said at a news conference. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='8534b71d7ac848ed827ec363ea6932ca' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>U.S. refugee efforts will also focus on helping refugees who are considered particularly vulnerable following the Russian invasion, groups that include LGBTQ people, those with medical needs as well as journalists and dissidents, according to administration officials, who spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan before the public announcement. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The administration did not provide a timeline but it's typically a lengthy process and the officials said all 100,000 may not necessarily arrive this year. Most of the refugees probably will settle in parts of the U.S. that already have large concentrations of Ukrainians. Such areas include the New York City area, Pennsylvania, Chicago and Northern California.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>IS THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES? \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Not relative to the need, considering the number who have already fled Ukraine and the millions more who are displaced within the country. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It's also not large by historic standards. The U.S. took in more than 200,000 refugees, mostly from Southeast Asia, in 1980 alone. The total between 1975-1981 was more than 735,000, according to State Department figures. Since August, when the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, the U.S. has admitted more than 76,000 Afghans, including large numbers of former military interpreters and their families. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The administration, in consultation with Congress, set the annual cap of refugees for the 2022 budget year at 125,000, a total that does not include the evacuated Afghans. The administration says it does not immediately plan to seek to raise the cap because many of the Ukrainians can be brought to the U.S. under humanitarian parole or family reunification programs that are not counted against this cap.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT HAS BEEN THE REACTION? \u003c/p>\u003cp>Refugee advocates had been urging the administration to expedite admissions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That's even as refugee resettlement agencies were struggling because of program cuts under President Donald Trump, whose administration slashed the refugee admissions cap to a historic low of 15,000.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Advocates welcomed Thursday's announcement, as did members of members of Congress with large Ukrainian populations in their districts, such as New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"Until today, the rate of Ukraine refugee acceptance by our nation has lacked urgency,\" he said. “But this morning’s announcement by the Biden administration to accept 100,000 refugees from Ukraine has the urgency that is essential for this dark moment.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>There seems to be public support as well.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The vast majority of Americans -- 82% -- say they favor providing humanitarian support to refugees from Ukraine, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. A smaller but still wide majority, 67%, say they favor accepting refugees from Ukraine into the U.S. Just 13% are opposed while another 21% say they hold neither opinion. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press polling writer Hannah Fingerhut contributed to this report. \u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Asia","name":"Asia","canonicalName":"asia","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedStates","name":"United States","canonicalName":"united-states","isPr":false},{"id":"Migration","name":"Migration","canonicalName":"migration","isPr":false},{"id":"SoutheastAsia","name":"Southeast Asia","canonicalName":"southeast-asia","isPr":false},{"id":"EasternEurope","name":"Eastern Europe","canonicalName":"eastern-europe","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c809eb2c008ffb34adb2c19c3eca7198","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c809eb2c008ffb34adb2c19c3eca7198","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:c809eb2c008ffb34adb2c19c3eca7198","shortId":"c809eb2c008ffb34adb2c19c3eca7198","bylines":"The Associated Press","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-business-europe","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — The Russian stock market opened Thursday for limited trading under heavy restrictions for the first time since \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\">Moscow invaded Ukraine\u003c/a>, coming almost a month after prices plunged and the market was shut down as a way to insulate the economy.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Russian stock market, crushed by war, opens with big limits","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"c37f9484a34043f8ad1d32bffd21c9a5","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/c809eb2c008ffb34adb2c19c3eca7198","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"c37f9484a34043f8ad1d32bffd21c9a5","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - A woman stands in a currency exchange office in St. Petersburg, Russia, on Feb. 25, 2022.

choice for America's top diplomat in December 1996.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Albright, whose family said she died Wednesday of cancer at age 84, was the daughter of a Czech diplomat, and was born just as Adolf Hitler’s Germany started its move down a path of conquest. The bleak years that followed uprooted Albright’s family and intimidated Europe.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>She grew to be outspoken and advised women years later “to act in a more confident manner” and “to ask questions when they occur and don’t wait to ask.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent,” Albright told HuffPost Living in 2010.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='afs:Card:709229193465' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>Her determination to use her academic background and her instinct for world affairs, combined with a formidable drive, led to her becoming the first woman to head the State Department. She was not part of the presidential line of succession, however, because of her birth outside the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For decades, Albright was a popular professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, where her “Modern Foreign Governments” was a required course and examined autocracies and the rise and fall of nation states, including in Ethiopia, the Czech Republic and the Soviet Union. A scholar influenced heavily by the Cold War, she also took a profound interest in arms control and was a proponent of combating dictatorships. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Albright remained outspoken after leaving government. She criticized President George W. Bush for using “the shock of force” rather than alliances to foster diplomacy. She said he had driven away moderate Arab leaders and created the potential for a dangerous rift with European allies.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='16768568a9a74cb9988fbaeb5265e70f' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked her in January 2007 whether she approved of Bush’s proposed “surge” in U.S. troops in bloodied Iraq, she responded: “I think we need a surge in diplomacy. We are viewed in the Middle East as a colonial power and our motives are suspect.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>An internationalist, Albright was shaped in part by her background as a refugee. She played a key role in persuading Clinton to go to war against the Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic over his brutal treatment of Kosovar Albanians in 1999.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“My mindset is Munich,” she said frequently, referring to the German city where the Western allies in 1938 abandoned her homeland to the Nazis.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>She helped win Senate ratification of NATO’s expansion and a treaty imposing international restrictions on chemical weapons. She led a successful fight to keep Egyptian diplomat Boutros Boutros-Ghali from a second term as secretary-general of the United Nations; he accused her of deception and posing as a friend.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A Democrat, she was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Clinton’s first term, but sought to work with Republicans in Congress on issues ranging from Russia to Cuba. As secretary of state she worked with both political parties to reform the State Department and the U.S. Information Agency, which had run Washington's anti-Soviet messaging since the end of World War II. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Albright advocated a tough U.S. foreign policy, particularly in the case of Milosevic’s treatment of Bosnia. She once exclaimed to Colin Powell, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff: “What’s the point of having this superb military you’re always talking about if we can’t use it?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Albright has known firsthand what tyranny and totalitarianism can do to ordinary people,” said Michael Zantovsky, a Czech ambassador to Washington. “The lesson of Munich is that you do not appease aggressors, you stick by your friends, and you take a stand for values and principles that you really believe in.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I am an eternal optimist,” Albright said in 1998, amid an effort to promote peace in the Middle East. But she said getting Israel to pull back on the West Bank and the Palestinians to rout terrorists posed serious problems.\u003c/p>\u003cp>As secretary of state, she made limited progress at first in trying to expand the 1993 Oslo accords that established the principle of self-rule for the Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But in 1998, she played a leading role in formulating the Wye Accords that turned over control of about 40% of the West Bank to the Palestinians. Still, a comprehensive peace in the Middle East between Israel and the Arabs eluded the Clinton administration.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Albright also helped guide U.S. foreign policy during conflicts in the Balkans and the Hutu-Tutsi genocide in Rwanda.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She enjoyed her reputation for plain-speaking. And she turned her love of jewelry into a weapon, telegraphing her messages with the brooch she chose to wear. Called a snake by the Iraqi government under Saddam Hussein, she sported a snake pin during a U.N. debate on Iraq.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“When devious, I wear a spider; when ready to sting, a bee,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Marie Jana Korbel was born in Prague on May 15, 1937, the daughter of diplomat Joseph Korbel. The family was Jewish and converted to Roman Catholicism when she was 5. Three of her Jewish grandparents died in concentration camps. Albright later said that she only became aware of her Jewish background after she became secretary of state.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The family returned to Czechoslovakia after World War II, before fleeing again, this time to the United States, in 1948, after the communists rose to power. They settled in Denver, where her father obtained a job at the University of Denver.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She married journalist and publishing heir Joseph Albright in 1959, three days after her graduation from Wellesley College. They had three daughters before divorcing in 1983.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Years later, in an interview with biographer Ann Blackman, Albright said: “Do powerful women attract men? My own experience happens to be yes, in a way that was not true before.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>After college she worked as a journalist and later studied international relations at Columbia University, where she earned a master’s degree in 1968 and a doctoral degree in 1976.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Democratic Sen. Edmund S. Muskie launched her career in politics and diplomacy as a legislative assistant in 1976. She later worked for the National Security Council during the Carter administration and advised Democrats on foreign policy before Clinton’s election. He nominated her as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1993.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was fluent in Russian, French and Czech, and knew some Polish, Serbian and German. When meeting in Moscow in 1997 with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, her grasp of Russian was so secure that Yeltsin waved away the interpreter as not necessary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Following her service in the Clinton administration, she headed a global strategy firm, Albright Stonebridge, and was chair of an investment advisory company that focused on emerging markets. She also wrote several books.\u003c/p>\u003cp>She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, by President Barack Obama in 2012.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>The late AP Diplomatic Correspondent Barry Schweid contributed to this report.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"ColinPowell","name":"Colin Powell","canonicalName":"colin-powell","isPr":false},{"id":"MadeleineAlbright","name":"Madeleine Albright","canonicalName":"madeleine-albright","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedNations","name":"United Nations","canonicalName":"united-nations","isPr":false},{"id":"Foreignpolicy","name":"Foreign policy","canonicalName":"foreign-policy","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-trendingnews","name":"Trending News","canonicalName":"trending-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-mideast","name":"Middle East","canonicalName":"middle-east","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Diplomacy","name":"Diplomacy","canonicalName":"diplomacy","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedStates","name":"United States","canonicalName":"united-states","isPr":false},{"id":"BillClinton","name":"Bill Clinton","canonicalName":"bill-clinton","isPr":false},{"id":"Germany","name":"Germany","canonicalName":"germany","isPr":false},{"id":"Bidencabinet","name":"Biden cabinet","canonicalName":"biden-cabinet","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:de557d1773a150fa975769d7216fa54f","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:de557d1773a150fa975769d7216fa54f","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:de557d1773a150fa975769d7216fa54f","shortId":"de557d1773a150fa975769d7216fa54f","bylines":null,"canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-middle-east-miami-europe-paul-manafort","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>MIAMI (AP) — Former Trump adviser Paul Manafort was removed from a plane at Miami International Airport before it took off for Dubai because he carried a revoked passport, officials said Wednesday. \u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Trump aide Manafort removed from plane for revoked passport","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"f373b5dfee5147e292d34653e848930a","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/de557d1773a150fa975769d7216fa54f","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"f373b5dfee5147e292d34653e848930a","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>FILE - In this May 23, 2018, photo, Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves the Federal District Court after a hearing in Washington.

Florida Gulf Coast in 2013 and Oral Roberts last year both failed to reach the regional final.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The bracket-busting from the team in the 3,200-seat gym had it going national. Holloway pitched the Peacocks on “Good Morning America” and the upset earned laughs on late-night TV talk shows.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Of course, people have already started their spring cleaning,” Jimmy Fallon joked the day of the UK win. “For example, today everyone threw out their March Madness brackets.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Fallon cracked that even Saint Peter’s players had busted their own brackets: “We had Kentucky.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Hey, not everyone is a #StrutUp believer. Saint Peter’s still hasn’t won over the bettors. Third-seeded Purdue is a 12 1/2-point favorite, \u003ca href=\"https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/\">according to FanDuel Sportsbook\u003c/a>, easily the largest spread of the eight semifinal games. The Peacocks’ element of surprise is no more.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s just basketball. I don’t think you should go into any game being intimidated by anybody,” forward KC Ndefo said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Peacocks punted on the “us against the world” attitude that so many underdogs embrace and invited all new fans to come along for the ride.

It’s been tremendous. The support has been unbelievable.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>And why not? The Peacocks have won nine straight games, kind of unbelievable for a team that was 7-7 at one point this season and had a 27-day COVID break. They didn’t play from Dec. 18 to Jan. 14 and have gone 18-5 since, coming out of the hiatus a whole new team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We had a chance to have a mini-camp to get ready and get back,” Holloway said. “Since the COVID pause this team has been a different team. We’ve kind of been locked in and followed the goal, and the goal was always be a defensive-first team.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The win streak grew faster than the bushy mop of hair on Edert’s head. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Edert and his ’stache have blown up social media, though he’s found getting a verified account on Instagram is harder than beating the Wildcats. Saint Peter’s demanded Twitter “ \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/PeacocksMBB/status/1504647407287648257?s=20&amp;t=uwkfuyjYpEvC6zQLT8PSIA\">Verify us\u003c/a> ” (it got the blue checkmark), then it called ESPN announcer Jay Bilas a “coward” when he re-seeded the bracket and put the Peacocks 16th.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But some questions about the Peacocks remain: Is Edert a traditional wing or boneless guy? Blue Cheese or ranch?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Edert didn’t want to talk wings, just wins.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And he’s convinced the Peacocks aren’t done yet.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The only thing that matters right now is beating Purdue,” he said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>More AP coverage of March Madness: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"MarchMadness","name":"March Madness NCAA Tournament","canonicalName":"march-madness","isPr":false},{"id":"StPetersPeacocksmensbasketball","name":"St. Peter's Peacocks men's basketball","canonicalName":"st-peters-peacocks-mens-basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-sports","name":"Sports","canonicalName":"sports","isPr":false},{"id":"DougEdert","name":"Doug Edert","canonicalName":"doug-edert","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-CollegeSports","name":"College Sports","canonicalName":"college-sports","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-Basketball","name":"Basketball","canonicalName":"basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Philadelphia","name":"Philadelphia","canonicalName":"philadelphia","isPr":false},{"id":"Menscollegebasketball","name":"Men's college basketball","canonicalName":"mens-college-basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"Collegebasketball","name":"College basketball","canonicalName":"college-basketball","isPr":false},{"id":"state-NewYorkNewYork","name":"NYC State Wire","canonicalName":"nyc-state-wire","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"MarchMadness","hubPeekTagName":"March Madness NCAA Tournament","hubPeekCanonicalName":"march-madness","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"APVideos","name":"AP Videos","canonicalName":"ap-videos","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Feature","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Feature","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"afs:Card:619962926284","shortId":"afs:Card:619962926284","allowAd":true,"borderColor":"#000000","brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":"97th Academy Awards","cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Hub Peek","collectionTagObjs":{"id":"AcademyAwards","name":"Academy Awards / Oscars","canonicalName":"academy-awards","isPr":false},"contents":[],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1d95a10f6b9385ff2c1acbb5158d5f20","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1d95a10f6b9385ff2c1acbb5158d5f20","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:1d95a10f6b9385ff2c1acbb5158d5f20","shortId":"1d95a10f6b9385ff2c1acbb5158d5f20","bylines":"By LINDSEY BAHR and JAKE COYLE","canonicalUrl":"2022-oscars-predictions","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>Ahead of the \u003ca href=\"https://oscars.org/\">94th Academy Awards this week\u003c/a>, Associated Press Film Writers Lindsey Bahr and Jake Coyle share their predictions for a ceremony with much still up in the air.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"Oscar predictions: Will 'Power of the Dog' reign supreme?","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"d0fe7db6142640be8092b8def963e559","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/1d95a10f6b9385ff2c1acbb5158d5f20","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"d0fe7db6142640be8092b8def963e559","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>This combination of photos shows promotional art for the films nominated for an Oscar for best picture, top row from left, \"Belfast,\" \"CODA,\" Don't Look Up,\" Drive My Car,\" Dune,\" bottom row from left, \"King Richard,\" Licorice Pizza,\" \"Nightmare Alley,\" \"The Power of the Dog,\" and \"West Side Story.\" (Focus Features/Apple TV+, Netflix, Janus Films & Sideshow, Warner Bros.

Jane Campion’s last major shot at picture (and director) was with “The Piano,” but in 1994 that basically stood no chance against “Schindler’s List.” This time, it’s her film that has the leg up on the Spielberg. And yet there is a possibility that “CODA” could “Little Miss Sunshine”/”Green Book” its way in there as the feel-good alternative — which was what “Belfast” was supposed to be. (Since this article was first published, the chances for “CODA” improved after winning \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-movies-dfcdc511b1096170e0374c0df4e1e7af\">the top honor at the Producers Guild this weekend.)\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:123935587246\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (AcademyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>COYLE: I'm \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-0070457a65779ef89baeeb4bd9208e44\">calling the “CODA” upset\u003c/a>. The smart money is on Campion's film. But the win for “CODA” at the Screen Actors Guild — where “The Power of the Dog” failed to get nominated for best ensemble — suggests strong passion for the film, and maybe a crowd-pleasing advantage on the academy's preferential ballot. Either film, though, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscar-nominations-academy-awards-6072fc4d4f4c03842a1d1df5d47984b4\">will symbolize the ascent of streaming in Hollywood\u003c/a>. It would hand a streaming service — Netflix or Apple — Hollywood's most prestigious honor for the first time.

Lady Gaga, Caitríona Balfe, Jennifer Hudson and my favorite performance of the year — Renate Reinsve (“The Worst Person in the World”) — are just some of the masses among the snubbed. Yet, surprisingly, a very Oscar bait-y performance from a movie released early in the season — \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-religion-arts-and-entertainment-jessica-chastain-rupaul-41be4cfba653f863ee050c1e5e51dd55\">Jessica Chastain as the televangelist Tammy Faye\u003c/a> — has moved to favorite status after winning the SAG Awards. That may partly be because Chastain, a three-time nominee but never a winner, is one of Hollywood’s best actors and the time has come to honor her, for a film she steered into existence. I think she’ll win, but \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-movies-olivia-colman-elena-ferrante-a8284ef2b7ddb53452db6e91fa412904\">Olivia Colman — typically brilliant in “The Lost Daughter” \u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"361d202664ad4a48a8256500428c557e\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>BAHR: Chastain should have already won several Oscars at this point, and not even necessarily for the ones she got nominations for (“The Help” and “Zero Dark Thirty”).

Smith might have already won best actor (for “Ali”) if not for Denzel's titanic performance that year in “Training Day.” This time, it's Smith's turn. If I could add someone here, it'd be Adam Driver in “Annette.\" If he can't have best actor, then he should surely take the award for most devastating and fiercely committed singing performance opposite a puppet baby. Wait, I'm being told that isn't an Oscar category.\u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"006f2d9ff40844e5bbfc39717c6e9fd9\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Nominees: Jessie Buckley, “The Lost Daughter”; Ariana DeBose, “West Side Story”; Judi Dench, “Belfast”; Kirsten Dunst, “The Power of the Dog”; Aunjanue Ellis, “King Richard.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Thanks to her \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-race-and-ethnicity-steven-spielberg-5e9b663d823501696ecdb19b801a7bd7\">show-stopping, breakthrough performance in “West Side Story” DeBose has had this category locked down all season\u003c/a>, and it’s hard not to be moved by the historical symmetry. Sixty years ago, Rita Moreno won for the same role, Anita, in 1961’s “West Side Story,\" making her the first Latina to win an Oscar. We’ll have to see if DeBose is as brief as Moreno was accepting her award. (Her total speech: “I can’t believe it! Good Lord! I leave you with that.”) Still, it was a crime to neglect Kathryn Hunter's multiplying witches in “Macbeth.\" What's foul isn't always fair. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: I was prepared for Kirsten Dunst to finally get her moment up on that podium but \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-sofia-coppola-academy-awards-jane-campion-0fb9007104b786446b74c4500d71f82b\">Kiki’s shrimp will have to wait\u003c/a>. At least she broke the seal and got a nomination. And DeBose should definitely be ready with a killer speech. Do you think she’ll take Moreno as her date? Maybe she’ll don the black and gold dress Moreno wore in 1962 and famously repeated in 2018. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"7bd875b89b174e1fa28da9a210294846\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Nominees: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-judi-dench-jamie-dornan-kenneth-branagh-belfast-1c2961b848ba94c3fbe16e585569c895\"> Ciarán Hinds, “Belfast”\u003c/a>; Troy Kotsur, “CODA”; Jesse Plemons, “The Power of the Dog”; J.K. Simmons, “Being the Ricardos”; Kodi Smit-McPhee, “The Power of the Dog.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Among mostly first-time nominees (save for J.K. Simmons, who previously won for “Whiplash”), “CODA’s” \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/academy-awards-entertainment-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-new-york-931ad6b8c320cf1ede311dc6764ee30a\">Troy Kotsur went from breakthrough to frontrunner over the past couple months\u003c/a>, winning at SAG, BAFTAs and Critics Choice and he’s likely to continue that streak come Oscar Sunday. The support for Kotsur and “CODA” has only become more enthusiastic recently and it would be a history-making win. The 53-year-old is the first deaf man to have ever been nominated for an acting prize. I’d also liked to have seen Colman Domingo get some more widespread praise for “Zola,” or Mike Faist for “West Side Story.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: It's a very likeable group of performers but Kotsur has this one in the bag. I think it will be one of the night's best moments, not just because of the historic nature of Kotsur's win, but because it's just reward for an actor who has long toiled and thrived on Los Angeles stages. Hinds was, though, fabulous in “Belfast” and the unnominated Richard Jenkins in “The Humans” was also about as good as it gets. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BEST DIRECTOR\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"d996d5c059a44915b3b314350c750030\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Nominees: Kenneth Branagh, “Belfast”; Ryûsuke Hamaguchi, “Drive My Car”; Paul Thomas Anderson, “Licorice Pizza”; Jane Campion, “The Power of the Dog”; Steven Spielberg, “West Side Story.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Campion has long been the frontrunner. For the trailblazing filmmaker, who nearly three decades ago became only the second woman nominated in this category, it’s a coronation long in coming. Campion, the first woman ever to be twice nominated for best director, will win, and her cinematographer, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/oscars-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-new-zealand-jane-campion-38f993ca3f60cb20f4a9e3ede5693011\">Ari Wegner\u003c/a>, will become the first woman to win that award — a triumph that should have happened long ago for women behind the camera. \u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Yes, but will she thank Sam Elliott?\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOCUMENTARY\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"f8bd2fceeba34b28b6fecc6093753aa9\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Ascension”; “Attica”; “Flee”; “Summer of Soul (Or, When The Revolution Could Not Be Televised)”; “Writing With Fire.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: Though Questlove is much-beloved by the Academy and his documentary \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-c58e5c5c0efdd19d95a8da3c3cd07c1b\">“Summer of Soul,” which won at the BAFTAs, would be more than deserving\u003c/a>, “Flee” likely has the advantage here since it was also nominated in the animated feature category. Also, while “Attica” director Stanley Nelson won the Directors Guild award, that group is narrower than the Academy’s voting body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: To quote the Roots, Questlove's Oscar has “got to be, got to be reality.” Don't get me wrong, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-entertainment-europe-new-york-migration-e58d5536f87b70af52c8ced2711dc265\">“Flee” is a singularly exquisite film\u003c/a>, and this could indeed be close. But “Summer of Soul” might be the most universally adored film of the year. Both its uncovering of a lost Black history and its celebration of live performance were so profoundly suited to 2021. I can't see it not winning. \u003c/p>\u003cp>INTERNATIONAL FEATURE\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"b2e0ba740885423daadbab2123aecd45\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Drive My Car,” Japan; “Flee,” Denmark; “The Hand of God,” Italy; “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom,” Bhutan; “The Worst Person in the World,” Norway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/academy-awards-entertainment-lifestyle-arts-and-entertainment-movies-35dd430836840fbd2cd4e7bdbdb69499\">“Drive My Car\" is a not-crazy best-picture underdog\u003c/a>, which makes it a heavyweight in this category. There's stiff competition here — particularly from \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-europe-arts-and-entertainment-new-york-movies-16399028267b9f730055f4e1a2f923e4\"> Joachim Trier's supremely lovely “The Worst Person in the World.”\u003c/a> But Hamaguchi's three-hour masterwork — a profound movie about art and dialogue as a means of human connection — should win.\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: “Drive My Car” definitely has the advantage. The picture and director nominations probably helped convince a few more voting members to give it a chance, too. It's hard not to wonder just how far it could have gone had it had the awards campaign budgets of some of its best picture brethren. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"10e32dee83a84e4eb2711e5e837ffa90\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>ANIMATED FEATURE\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Nominees: “Encanto”; “Flee”; “Luca”; “The Mitchells vs. the Machines”; “Raya and the Last Dragon.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>BAHR: “Encanto” is certainly the juggernaut in this category, with the triple threat of Disney, Lin-Manuel Miranda and a massive hit song that \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-lifestyle-travel-academy-awards-movies-ab20cdddb782b62e0f491c3f5b940d25\"> we won’t talk about here (no, no, no)\u003c/a>. And under normal circumstances it’d be the easy frontrunner, but Disney has not had a good few weeks not to mention the fact that the studio has three nominations in the category which could split votes. Plus, there is massive industry goodwill for “The Mitchells vs the Machines” and it won the Annie award, which is why I think there may be a (good) upset in store.\u003c/p>\u003cp>COYLE: I think “The Mitchells vs the Machines” pulls it off. \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/film-reviews-entertainment-reviews-arts-and-entertainment-movies-d04ad9807894c297d5860020ca463abc\">“Encanto” may be the favorite\u003c/a>, but it's a funny kind of juggernaut. The Disney release didn't make a huge impression in theaters but once it hit streaming, its songs turned it into a sensation. Some voters may feel “Encanto” is great for the music, while \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/reviews-technology-entertainment-arts-and-entertainment-d0fe967abc7b9e6ac51979b7bbfe3679\">“The Mitchells vs the Machines” is the better movie overall\u003c/a>.

Am I having a panic attack?’” Ahmed said in a recent interview from London. “Aneil and I wanted to urgently tell a story about this, to spill our feelings, to unearth our nightmares and put them out into the world.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The scenes that play out in “The Long Goodbye” appear more like those that might occur in more remote global corners. But to Ahmed, the film reflects both the day-to-day emotional reality of diverse peoples in increasingly divisive Western democracies, and the on-the-ground actuality in other places.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Really, where this story takes places is within our psyches. But it also takes place within our ancestral memories,” says Ahmed. “It takes place in Ukraine right now. It takes place in India, with the pogroms last year. It takes place in Myanmar. It’s taken place in the United States. It’s taken place in Bosnia.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>“The Long Goodbye” isn’t the only Oscar nominee to wrestle with these issues — or the only one Ahmed is connected with. Ahmed is also \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ut92k4If__A\">an executive producer on “Flee,”\u003c/a> the animated documentary \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-entertainment-europe-new-york-migration-e58d5536f87b70af52c8ced2711dc265\">about an Afghanistan migrant’s twisting path to a new life in Denmark and, ultimately, to self-acceptance.\u003c/a> “Flee” is the first movie ever nominated for best documentary, best animated film and best foreign language film. \u003c/p>\u003cp>\"‘The Long Goodbye’ is about identity, home and belonging. And ‘Flee’ is about identity, home and belonging,” says Ahmed. “The conversation of our times seems to be about identity, home and who belongs where.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ahmed made history last year as the first Muslim nominated for lead actor, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/riz-ahmed-sound-of-metal-film-90d4ede08697198920fedd3f6733f26c\">for “The Sound of Metal,”\u003c/a> in which he played a drummer losing his hearing. This year, the short categories are among the eight awards \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/academy-awards-entertainment-music-arts-and-entertainment-01de49b2ddeeaa64d0dba6e594641777\">that will be handed out an hour before the telecast begins\u003c/a>. While the academy has pledged to honor each winner during the broadcast, the decision has been heavily criticized by some in the industry. Ahmed says regardless of whether he had a film nominated in one of the eight categories, he wishes they were presented live during the telecast. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“The (Oscar) community is about recognizing the elders and also uplifting the newcomers,” says Ahmed. “So often the shorts category is where the new talent cuts their teeth. Aneil Karia is a name that will ring out for years to come.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The 39-year-old Ahmed, who was born in Wembley outside London to Pakistani parents, has often rapped about his complex feelings around identity and about making his way “in this business of Britishness.” “Maybe I’m from everywhere and nowhere,” he raps in “Where You From.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Ahmed has worked with USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative researchers to highlight how Muslims are often marginalized or stereotyped in film and television. Out of 8,965 speaking characters identified across 200 top-grossing films released between 2017 and 2019, just 1.6% were Muslim, but 30% were perpetuators of violence. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Though its second half turns abruptly violent, the fleeting family scenes early in “The Long Goodbye” are enough to constitute something rarely captured in mainstream film — a Muslim family simply existing. While Ahmed grants “The Long Goodbye” and “Flee” are very tied to the current moment, he also sees them as reflecting an eternal struggle — one that can also be heard in the Lin-Manuel Miranda-penned “Dos Oruguitas,\" the “Encanto” ballad and immigration parable up for best song at the Oscars.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Stories about refugees, stories about intolerance, films like ‘The Long Goodbye,’ films like ‘Flee,’ are confronting us with questions that on some level, no matter who we are, are always asking ourselves,” says Ahmed. “That’s why I think these are timeless stories. You look at the Aeneid. Aeneas is kicked out of Troy. It’s ransacked and he’s a refugee. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“He went on to found Rome, by the way. Not bad for a refugee,” adds Ahmed, chuckling. “Maybe up there with Apple and Steve Jobs, a Syria refugee.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But if “The Long Goodbye” seems grim, it's also stirring in its clarion defiance, sounded straight at the camera. In its radical shifts, Karia’s film, itself, breaks free of convention. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When you tell your story, you’re sharing your experience with someone,” says Ahmed. “You’re putting yourself out there to connect. And when other people connect with that experience, man, that is hope. Hope is connection.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\">http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>For more on this year’s Oscars, visit: \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards\">https://apnews.com/hub/academy-awards\u003c/a>\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"AcademyAwards","name":"Academy Awards / Oscars","canonicalName":"academy-awards","isPr":false},{"id":"Immigration","name":"Immigration","canonicalName":"immigration","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-entertainment","name":"Entertainment","canonicalName":"entertainment","isPr":false},{"id":"RizAhmed","name":"Riz Ahmed","canonicalName":"riz-ahmed","isPr":false},{"id":"Artsandentertainment","name":"Arts and entertainment","canonicalName":"arts-and-entertainment","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:18d7f5b3e75f1fd1f0d937cfa7004df0","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:18d7f5b3e75f1fd1f0d937cfa7004df0","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:18d7f5b3e75f1fd1f0d937cfa7004df0","shortId":"18d7f5b3e75f1fd1f0d937cfa7004df0","bylines":"By JAKE COYLE","canonicalUrl":"troy-kotsur-oscars-coda","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>NEW YORK (AP) — In his Oscar-nominated performance in \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmfrE1YL4I\">“CODA,”\u003c/a> Troy Kotsur has one spoken line, but it’s a good one.

Urging his daughter, played by Emilia Jones, to pursue her dreams of singing and attending college, he says aloud: “Go!” \u003c/p>\u003cp>For Kotsur, that one line meant lots of rehearsal plus the courage to, on a film set, speak dialogue he couldn’t himself hear. But Kotsur had also done it before. Years before, as Stanley Kowalski in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.deafwest.org/\">Deaf West Theatre \u003c/a> production of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” he exclaimed “Stella!” night after night. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Sometimes I’ll ask hearing audience members what my voice sounds like,” signs Kotsur. “One person described it as feeling like being cozy and tucked in bed.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Kotsur, who does indeed radiate a rumpled warmth, is just the second actor who is deaf to be nominated for an Academy Award. And like that “Go!” the 53-year-old Kotsur hopes his achievement resonates with inspiration. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I hope that young people who happen to be deaf or hard of hearing can get an increased confidence and be inspired that they can pursue their dreams,” Kotsur says. “I want those kids to not feel limited.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Card:123935587246\" class=\"hub-peek-embed\">Hub peek embed (AcademyAwards) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) \u003c/div>\u003cp>The Apple TV+ release “CODA,” Sian Heder’s best-picture nominee, has elevated Kotsur to Hollywood’s biggest stages while making history for the Deaf community. He’s the first deaf actor ever nominated individually for \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-sag-award-nominations-7f5bc951edd86af8d7673d7760742035\"> a Screen Actors Guild award\u003c/a>. The rush of accolades has been discombobulating. When he was nominated for a BAFTA, he celebrated so much \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/sianheder/status/1489380550179639296?s=20&amp;t=zCIQgqsPfOYAE39UNx6ueg\">he fell out of his chair\u003c/a>.

I feel like I can die happy, with a smile on my face.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>The only one to ever go through something similar was Kotsur’s “CODA” co-star Marlee Matlin. In “CODA,” they play the parents of a deaf Gloucester fishing family with a hearing daughter. Kotsur remembers watching Matlin become the first deaf actor to win an Oscar, in 1987 for “Children of a Lesser God.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I felt like I could have hope as a deaf actor,” Kotsur remembered in an interview by Zoom from his home in Mesa, Arizona, through an interpreter. “Of course, I didn’t realize what a tough journey it would be going through show business.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Kotsur’s long road to the Oscars began, he figures, in elementary school. With little TV programming accessible to him, Kotsur loved highly visual cartoons like “Tom and Jerry” and would animatedly retell them to his deaf classmates on the bus. His father, a police chief, would later fondly call Kotsur a “risk taker” for pursuing performing. He studied acting at Gallaudet University, and then toured with the National Theatre of the Deaf. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With few opportunities in television and film available for deaf actors, Kotsur found freedom on the stage. Beginning with “Of Mice and Men” in 1994, Kotsur has acted in some 20 productions at Deaf West, the nonprofit Los Angeles theater company founded in 1991. In one show, he met his wife, the actress Deanne Bray. He played Cyrano de Bergerac and starred in “American Buffalo.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"50d35252b0304871bafc1c296dbc8bfd\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>DJ Kurs, director of Deaf West, remembers first being “utterly drawn in by Kotsur’s magnetism” in “Streetcar.” Many times since, he’s seen Kotsur’s immersive process close up.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Working with him in rehearsal is like being in the presence of a mad scientist,” Kurs said by email. “He’s always tinkering and fine-tuning, bringing in different elements of the character. This process doesn’t end until the moment the curtain goes up on opening night.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>On stage, Kotsur honed the full-body physicality of his acting. “It’s really important for me on stage to show emotion through sign language,” says Kotsur. “Sometimes, sign language can be more three-dimensional and meaningful than spoken dialogue.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Heder first saw Kotsur in a pair of Deaf West plays: “At Home in the Zoo” and “Our Town.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“And they were very different characters,” she said. “He’s so charismatic, especially on stage. He’s just got this amazing presence and he’s so funny.” \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kotsur had long been used to seeing one-dimensional and victimized deaf characters, but “CODA” presented something he had rarely seen. The Rossis of “CODA” may have to work a little harder but they’re a family like any other, with funny dinner-table conversation and casual bickering. Kotsur’s Frank is also a little randy and a little profane. In one scene in which he instructs his daughter on safe sex, he mimes a soldier putting on a helmet. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Kotsur, long accustomed to hearing actors curse, delighted in Frank’s vulgarity; he proudly recalls the film’s back-and-forth with the MPA after “CODA” nearly received an R-rating. But to Kotsur, Frank is like a real deaf person — “a hard-working deaf person that just makes it through.” \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"e88b2f7dec574555aa978640d8a07313\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>“I want the audience to have a different perspective. I want them to get rid of their preconceived notions of what deaf people are like,” says Kotsur. “There are deaf doctors. There are deaf lawyers. There are deaf firemen. A lot of hearing people are oblivious to that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Perhaps Kotsur’s most moving scene is a moment shared in the bed of his truck with his daughter, Ruby. Unable to grasp Ruby’s singing talent, he listens to her sing by tenderly feeling the vibrations of her neck. The scene has deep echoes in Kotsur’s own life; he and Bray’s 17-year-old daughter is also a CODA (child of deaf adults) who's drawn to music. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“When my daughter is playing music, she doesn’t know I’m standing behind her. I’ll walk up and I’ll touch the body of the acoustic guitar and I can feel the vibrations of the guitar,” says Kotsur. “I can do the same with the piano. I can rest my arms on the grand piano and feel the vibrations when she’s practicing.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I had to go to the music store and I was like, ‘What the hell is the difference between an electric and acoustic guitar?’ So I decided to buy both and give that to my daughter,” he adds. “I really enjoy watching her be so motivated with music as her hobby. I can’t take that passion away from her. I just need to encourage her.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The first time Kotsur read the script for “CODA,” he took it as a warning sign since he, like his character, isn’t quite ready for his daughter to leave home yet. It’s personal connections like these that have made Frank difficult for the actor to let go of. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It took me about half a year to disconnect from Frank,” says Kotsur. “My wife said, ‘Troy, will you please shave that beard? I can’t even kiss you.’”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"a8923c19f81740ab87b3785cc32af970\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>To Kurs, Kotsur is nothing less than a trailblazer. Because of him and Matlin, he says, there will be more work for deaf actors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Seeing the acclaim validates what we’ve known all along, that Troy is one of the greats,” says Kurs. “We’ve been waiting for the world to recognize it for some time now and it is our hope that Troy will get all of the work and kudos that he is so deserving of, and that future deaf actors will not have to wait so long to be recognized on this level.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>A now more neatly trimmed Kotsur has since gone on to appear in the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian” as a Tusken Raider, for which he developed his own sign language. Other parts await, as does an expected lecturing tour talking to deaf children and would-be actors. But for now, he’s soaking it up as much as possible. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m trying to enjoy every day and every moment,” he says. “I’m not in a rush. I’m not obsessed with winning.

A crowd formed at one of the roads leading away from the city, but a police officer blocked their path. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Everything is mined, the ways out of town are being shelled,” he told them. “Trust me, I have family at home, and I am also worried about them.

They left a crater two stories deep in the courtyard. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Rescuers rushed a pregnant woman through the rubble and light snow as she stroked her bloodied belly, face blanched and head lolling listlessly to the side.

Texas' election was the debut of more restrictive voting rules the GOP raced to put on the books across the U.S. in time for the midterm elections, a push that took particular aim at mail voting that soared in popularity during the pandemic. \u003c/p>\u003cp>At least 17 other states in the coming months will cast ballots under tougher election laws, in part driven by Trump's baseless and persistent claims of rampant fraud in the 2020 election.

Some smaller counties did not provide data or respond to requests, but the 187 counties that provided full numbers to AP accounted for 85% of the 3 million people who voted in the primary.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last week, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-elections-austin-texas-voting-f28a41bf6482c25299c99a8ea52734be\">AP reported that 27,000 ballots had been flagged in Texas for initial rejection\u003c/a>, meaning those voters still had time to “fix” their ballot for several days after the primary and have it count. But the final figures suggest most voters did not. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The most rejections were around Houston, a Democratic stronghold, where Harris County elections officials reported that nearly 7,000 mail ballots — about 19% — were discarded. During the last midterm elections in 2018, Texas’ largest county only rejected 135 mail ballots. Harris County elections officials said they received more than 8,000 calls since January from voters seeking help, which they attributed to “confusion and frustration” over the new requirements. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In the five counties won by Trump that had the most mail-in primary voters, a combined 2,006 mailed ballots were rejected, a rate of 10% of the total. In the counties won by Biden with the most mail-in voters, which include most of Texas’ biggest cities, a combined 14,020 votes were similarly rejected, which amounted to 15.7%.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In rural East Texas, Annette Young voted by mail like usual but received a surprising letter a week after the primary, informing her that the ballot never counted because it didn’t comply with a new state law requiring mail voters to include personal identification numbers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just threw it right in the trash,” she said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the rejected ballots, according to county election officials and the Texas secretary of state, failed to adhere to the new identification requirements. The changes were part of the sweeping overhaul to Texas' elections that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law in October, saying at the time that “no one who is eligible to vote will be denied the opportunity to vote.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abbott and top Texas Republicans who championed the changes have largely been silent about the high rejection rates. Abbott's office did not respond to requests seeking comment, and messages for Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan also went unanswered. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, a proponent of the changes, said in an email that one issue might have been that ballot instructions printed in different ink colors — red for signature, black for identification numbers — might have left voters with the wrong impression they did not need to provide both. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Federal data on discarded mail ballots in general elections show few instances of double-digit rejection rates. The outliers include Indiana (14.5%) in 2006, Oregon (12.7%) in 2010 and New York (13.7%) in 2018, according to records from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Stewart, of MIT, said generally less is known about trends in primary elections because of lacking data. One assumption, he said, is that because primaries tend to draw the most habitual voters, they are less likely to mistakes that cause rejections. But Stewart said others believe that officials may have more time to scrutinize, and reject, ballot paperwork in low-turnout elections.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The new mail ballot requirements in Texas include listing an identification number — either a driver’s license or a Social Security number — on the ballot’s carrier envelope. That number must match the county’s records, and if a ballot is rejected, voters are given the opportunity to supply the missing information or simply cast a ballot in person instead.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It is unknown how many Texas voters whose mail ballots were rejected may have still had their vote count by deciding to just show up in person instead. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sam Taylor, a spokesman for the Texas secretary of state, said the office did not yet have its own final comprehensive numbers on ballot rejections. He said a “significant portion” of their efforts this year will be awareness about the new mail-in rules. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are confident we will have all the information we need to apply any lessons learned during the primary to an even more robust voter education campaign heading into the November general election,\" he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Delores Tarver Smith, 87, took no chances with a mail ballot this year. She applied in Harris County for a mail ballot Feb. 1, but when none arrived by election day, she went and voted in person. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Last Wednesday — more than a week after the primary — her absentee ballot finally showed up at her home. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I just went in person to vote, because I had to make sure my vote counted,” she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press data journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington, reporter Nicholas Riccardi in Denver; Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa; Jim Salter in St. Louis, Heather Hollingsworth in Mission, Kansas; Margaret Stafford in Kansas City; Andy Tubasa Field in Topeka, Kansas; Tammy Webber in Fenton, Michigan; and Kathleen Foody and Jeff McMurray in Chicago contributed to this report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Coronado and Field are corps members for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative. \u003ca href=\"https://www.reportforamerica.org/\"> Report for America\u003c/a> is a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":"2022-03-16 21:27:09","storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"2022Midtermelections","name":"2022 Midterm elections","canonicalName":"2022-midterm-elections","isPr":false},{"id":"APInvestigations","name":"AP Investigations","canonicalName":"ap-investigations","isPr":false},{"id":"Voting","name":"Voting","canonicalName":"voting","isPr":false},{"id":"OnlyonAP","name":"Only on AP","canonicalName":"only-on-ap","isPr":false},{"id":"Generalelections","name":"General elections","canonicalName":"general-elections","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Elections","name":"Elections","canonicalName":"elections","isPr":false},{"id":"Texas","name":"Texas","canonicalName":"texas","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","shortId":"10a82777a3b4a6ccafc38c223b659a03","bylines":"By MICHAEL BIESECKER","canonicalUrl":"russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-boris-johnson-europe-united-states","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>WASHINGTON (AP) — The massive superyacht Dilbar stretches one-and-a-half football fields in length, about as long as a World War I dreadnought.

Eclipse also boasts its own helicopter hangar and an undersea bay that reportedly holds a mini-sub.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Dennis Causier, a superyacht analyst with VesselsValue, said oligarch boats often include secret security measures worthy of a Bond villain, including underwater escape hatches, bulletproof windows and armored panic rooms.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Eclipse is equipped with all sorts of special features, including missile launchers and self-defense systems on board,” Causier said. “It has a secret submarine evacuation area and things like that.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Eclipse was soon eclipsed by Azzam, purportedly owned by the emir of Abu Dhabi, which claimed the title of longest yacht when it was launched in 2013. Three years after that, Usmanov launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/dilbar\">Dilbar\u003c/a>, which replaced another slightly smaller yacht by the same name. The new Dilbar is the world’s largest yacht by volume.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich, whose fortune is estimated at $12.4 billion, fired back last year by launching \u003ca href=\"https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/solaris-140m\">Solaris\u003c/a>. While not as long as Eclipse or as big as Dilbar, the $600 million Bermuda-flagged boat is possibly even more luxurious. Eight stories tall, Solaris features a sleek palisade of broad teak-covered decks suitable for hosting a horde of well-heeled partygoers.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But no boat is top dog for long. At least 20 superyachts are reported to be under construction in various Northern European shipyards, including a $500 million superyacht being \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeff-bezos-yacht-dutch-bridge-a24e8696be86eb3ae5f56d8e7a648c04\">built for the American billionaire Jeff Bezos.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s about ego,” Causier said. “They all want to have the best, the longest, the most valuable, the newest, the most luxurious.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>But, he added, the escalating U.S. and EU sanctions on Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian banks have sent a chill through the industry, with boatbuilders and staff worried they won’t be paid. It can cost upwards of $50 million a year to crew, fuel and maintain a superyacht.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The crash of the ruble and the tanking of Moscow stock market have depleted the fortunes of Russia’s elite, with several people dropping off the list of Forbes billionaires last week. Causier said he expects some oligarch superyachts will soon quietly be listed by brokers at fire-sale prices.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The 237-foot Stella Maris, which was seen by an AP journalist docked this past week in Nice, France, was believed to be owned by Rashid Sardarov, a Russian billionaire oil and gas magnate. After publication of an earlier version of this story, AP was contacted Sunday by yacht broker Joan Plana Palao, who said his company represents a U.S. citizen from California who purchased the Stella Maris last month. He declined to disclose the name of the buyer or the person from whom the boat had been purchased.\u003c/p>\u003cp>On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a new round of sanctions that included a \u003ca href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0628\">press release\u003c/a> touting Usmanov’s close ties to Putin and photos of Dilbar and the oligarch’s private jet, a custom-built 209-foot Airbus A340-300 passenger liner. Treasury said Usmanov’s aircraft is believed to have cost up to $500 million and is named Bourkhan, after his father. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Usmanov, whose fortune has recently shrunk to about $17 billion, criticized the sanctions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“I believe that such a decision is unfair and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honor, dignity and business reputation,” he said in a \u003ca href=\"https://fie.org/articles/1158\">statement\u003c/a> issued through the website of the International Fencing Federation, of which he has served as president since 2008. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Abramovich has not yet been sanctioned. Members of the British Parliament have criticized Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not going after Abramovich’s U.K.-based assets, which include the professional soccer club Chelsea. Under mounting pressure, the oligarch announced this past week he would \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-sports-soccer-europe-premier-league-907c65a988ec91fd28cfd620078935d7\">sell the $2.5 billion team\u003c/a> and give the net proceeds “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Meanwhile, location transponders showed Solaris \u003ca href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:6570613/mmsi:310792000/imo:9819820/vessel:MY_SOLARIS\">moored in Barcelona\u003c/a>, Spain, on Saturday. \u003ca href=\"https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:371584/mmsi:310593000/imo:1009613/vessel:ECLIPSE\">Eclipse\u003c/a> set sail from St. Maarten late Thursday and is underway in the Caribbean Sea, destination undisclosed.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writer Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow AP Investigative Reporter Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Contact AP’s global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{"type":null,"background":null},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":"bottom left","relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Russia-Ukraine","name":"Russia-Ukraine war","canonicalName":"russia-ukraine","isPr":false},{"id":"VladimirPutin","name":"Vladimir Putin","canonicalName":"vladimir-putin","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-politics","name":"Politics","canonicalName":"politics","isPr":false},{"id":"BorisJohnson","name":"Boris Johnson","canonicalName":"boris-johnson","isPr":false},{"id":"APInvestigations","name":"AP Investigations","canonicalName":"ap-investigations","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-europe","name":"Europe","canonicalName":"europe","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"UnitedStates","name":"United States","canonicalName":"united-states","isPr":false},{"id":"EuropeanUnion","name":"European Union","canonicalName":"european-union","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"null","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","shortId":"7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","bylines":"By GARANCE BURKE, MARTHA MENDOZA, JULIET LINDERMAN and MICHAEL TARM","canonicalUrl":"artificial-intelligence-algorithm-technology-police-crime","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":null,"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":0,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>CHICAGO (AP) — Michael Williams’ wife pleaded with him to remember their fishing trips with the grandchildren, how he used to braid her hair, anything to jar him back to his world outside the concrete walls of Cook County Jail.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"How AI-powered tech landed man in jail with scant evidence","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"30b09fd23d1745e2b89cf69c5e676ec9","leadVideoId":"9c6011b26c1845e9b83d158230830356","localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/7e3345485aa668c97606d4b54f9b6220","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"30b09fd23d1745e2b89cf69c5e676ec9","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Michael Williams sits for a portrait in his South Side Chicago home Tuesday, July 27, 2021.

Prosecutors said technology powered by a secret algorithm that analyzed noises detected by the sensors indicated Williams shot and killed the man.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I kept trying to figure out, how can they get away with using the technology like that against me?” said Williams, speaking publicly for the first time about his ordeal. “That’s not fair.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams sat behind bars for nearly a year before a judge dismissed the case against him last month at the request of prosecutors, who said they had insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"80b94f4b60654960aa86986353ba2f7f\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Williams’ experience highlights the real-world impacts of society’s growing reliance on algorithms to help make consequential decisions about many aspects of public life. Nowhere is this more apparent than in law enforcement, which has turned to technology companies like gunshot detection firm ShotSpotter to battle crime. ShotSpotter evidence has increasingly been admitted in court cases around the country, now totaling some 200. ShotSpotter’s website says it’s “a leader in precision policing technology solutions” that helps stop gun violence by using “sensors, algorithms and artificial intelligence” to classify 14 million sounds in its proprietary database as gunshots or something else.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But an Associated Press investigation, based on a review of thousands of internal documents, emails, presentations and confidential contracts, along with interviews with dozens of public defenders in communities where ShotSpotter has been deployed, has identified a number of serious flaws in using ShotSpotter as evidentiary support for prosecutors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>AP’s investigation found the system can miss live gunfire right under its microphones, or misclassify the sounds of fireworks or cars backfiring as gunshots. Forensic reports prepared by ShotSpotter’s employees have been used in court to improperly claim that a defendant shot at police, or provide questionable counts of the number of shots allegedly fired by defendants. Judges in a number of cases have thrown out the evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter’s proprietary algorithms are the company’s primary selling point, and it frequently touts the technology in marketing materials as virtually foolproof. But the company guards how its closed system works as a trade secret, a black box largely inscrutable to the public, jurors and police oversight boards.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The company’s methods for identifying gunshots aren’t always guided solely by the technology. ShotSpotter employees can, and often do, change the source of sounds picked up by its sensors after listening to audio recordings, introducing the possibility of human bias into the gunshot detection algorithm. Employees can and do modify the location or number of shots fired at the request of police, according to court records. And in the past, city dispatchers or police themselves could also make some of these changes.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"9092aeb0-f180-11eb-815e-95a094403815\" class=\"related-story-embed\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Amid a nationwide debate over racial bias in policing, privacy and civil rights advocates say ShotSpotter’s system and other algorithm-based technologies used to set everything from prison sentences to probation rules lack transparency and oversight and show why the criminal justice system shouldn’t outsource some of society’s weightiest decisions to computer code.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When pressed about potential errors from the company’s algorithm, ShotSpotter CEO Ralph Clark declined to discuss specifics about their use of artificial intelligence, saying it’s “not really relevant.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The point is anything that ultimately gets produced as a gunshot has to have eyes and ears on it,” said Clark in an interview. “Human eyes and ears, OK?” \u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se3:26d77ab0-f180-11eb-91ed-a9ed535dee29\">\u003cdiv>\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/afs:Medium:680568045053/1000.jpeg\" width=\"100%\">\u003c/div>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>This story, supported by the Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, is part of an ongoing Associated Press series, “Tracked,” that investigates the power and consequences of decisions driven by algorithms on people’s everyday lives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>A GAME CHANGER\u003c/p>\u003cp>Police chiefs call ShotSpotter a game-changer.

The system is usually placed at the request of local officials in neighborhoods deemed to be the highest risk for gun violence, which are often disproportionately Black and Latino communities. Law enforcement officials say it helps get officers to crime scenes quicker and helps cash-strapped public safety agencies better deploy their resources.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“ShotSpotter has turned into one of the most important cogs in our wheel of addressing gun violence,” said Toledo, Ohio Police Chief George Kral during a 2019 International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers who took a look at ShotSpotter’s impacts in communities where it is used came to a different conclusion. \u003ca href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929640/\">One study\u003c/a> published in April in the peer-reviewed Journal of Urban Health examined ShotSpotter in 68 large, metropolitan counties from 1999 to 2016, the largest review to date. It found that the technology didn’t reduce gun violence or increase community safety.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The evidence that we’ve produced suggests that the technology does not reduce firearm violence in the long-term, and the implementation of the technology does not lead to increased murder or weapons related arrests,” said lead author Mitch Doucette.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter installs its acoustic sensors on buildings, telephone poles and street lights.

They fed their Rottweiler Lily and German shepherd Shibey. Anderson fell asleep. Williams said he left the house to buy cigarettes at a gas station.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Looters had beaten him to it.

So, I said yes. And he got in the front seat, and we took off,” Williams said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>According to documents AP obtained through an open records request, Williams told police that as he approached an intersection another vehicle pulled up beside his car. A man in the front passenger seat fired a shot. The bullet missed Williams, but hit his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It shocked me so badly, the only thing I can do was slump down in my car,” he said. As Herring bled all over the seat from wounds to the side of his head, Williams ran a red light to escape.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I was hollering to my passenger ‘Are you ok?’” said Williams. “He didn’t respond.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Williams drove his passenger to St. Bernard Hospital, where medical workers rushed Herring into the emergency room and doctors fought to save his life.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Two weeks before being picked up by Williams, Samona Nicholson, Herring’s mother, said the aspiring chef had survived a shooting at a bus stop. Nicholson, who called her son ‘Pook,’ arranged for him to stay with a relative where she thought he’d be safe.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Doctors pronounced Herring dead on June 2, 2020, at 2:53 p.m.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For days after the shooting Williams’ wife said he curled up on his bed, having flashbacks and praying for his passenger.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Three months after Herring’s death, the police showed up.

Even during the pandemic, ShotSpotter participated in 18 court cases, some over Zoom, according to a recent company presentation to investors.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But even as its use has expanded in court, ShotSpotter’s technology has drawn scrutiny.\u003c/p>\u003cp>For one, the algorithm that analyzes sounds to distinguish gunshots from other noises has never been peer reviewed by outside academics or experts.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The concern about ShotSpotter being used as direct evidence is that there are simply no studies out there to establish the validity or the reliability of the technology. Nothing,” said Tania Brief, a staff attorney at The Innocence Project, a nonprofit that seeks to reverse wrongful convictions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://njdc.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Shot-Spotter-Gunshot-Location-System-Efficacy-Study.pdf\">A 2011 study\u003c/a> commissioned by the company found that dumpsters, trucks, motorcycles, helicopters, fireworks, construction, trash pickup and church bells have all triggered false positive alerts, mistaking these sounds for gunshots. Clark said the company is constantly improving its audio classifications, but the system still logs a small percentage of false positives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the past, these false alerts — and lack of alerts — have prompted cities from Charlotte, North Carolina, to San Antonio, Texas, to end their ShotSpotter contracts, the AP found. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Fall River, Massachusetts, police said ShotSpotter worked less than 50% of the time and missed all seven shots in a downtown murder in 2018. The results didn’t improve over time, and later that year ShotSpotter turned off its system.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The public school district in Fresno, California, ended its ShotSpotter contract last year, after paying $1.25 million over four years and finding it too costly. Also, parents and board members were concerned that district funds meant to help high-needs students were used to pay for ShotSpotter, said school board trustee Genoveva Islas.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We were at the point where George Floyd had been murdered and there was a lot of push around racism and discrimination in the district. There was this mounting questioning about that investment in particular,” Islas said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Some courts, too, have been less than impressed with the ShotSpotter system. In 2014, a judge in Richmond, California, didn’t allow ShotSpotter evidence to be used during a gang murder conspiracy case, although the accused man, Todd Gillard, was still convicted of being involved in a drive-by shooting.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The expert testimony that a gun was fired at a particular location at a given time, based on the ShotSpotter technology, is not presently admissible in court, because it has not, at this point, reached general acceptance in the relevant scientific community,” ruled Contra Costa Superior Court Judge John Kennedy. ShotSpotter later provided AP with additional court records showing that three years later, Kennedy reconsidered admissibility of the ShotSpotter evidence, and found that it could be admitted.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"0adf0b6a8e8b4d2b9f00315bfa3fa333\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In a Chicago case, prosecutors had surveillance videos of gang member Ernesto Godinez in a neighborhood where an ATF agent was shot after dark — but none showing him actually shooting a gun. At a 2019 trial, they entered ShotSpotter data to show gunshots originated from the location where video evidence indicated Godinez was when shots rang out. This month, a federal appeals court ruled that a trial judge erred by not vetting the reliability of ShotSpotter data before letting jurors hear it. Nonetheless, the split three-judge panel concluded that other evidence prosecutors presented was enough to uphold Godinez’s conviction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter says it’s constantly fine-tuning its machine learning model to recognize what is and isn’t a gunshot sound by getting detectives and investigators to add crime scene observations to its system. As a part of that process, which they call “ground truth,” ShotSpotter asks patrol officers to add and notate shell casings, bullet holes, gather witness testimony and other “evidence of gunfire” using its software.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We have the opportunity to make the machine classification better and better and better because we get real-world feedback loops from humans,” Clark said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"4118231669df47f6a6fea817c10e55ef\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Several experts warned that training an algorithm based on a set of observations submitted by police risks contaminating the model if harried officers — perhaps inadvertently — feed it incomplete or incorrect data.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m kind of aghast,” said Clare Garvie, a senior associate with the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law. “You are building an inherent uncertainty into that system, and you are telling that system it’s fine. You are contaminating the reliability of your system.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter said the more data it receives from police, the more accurate its model becomes. The company says their system is accurate 97% of the time.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“In the small number of cases where ShotSpotter is incorrect, providing feedback to the algorithm can improve accuracy,” the company said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond the ShotSpotter algorithm, other questions have been raised about how the company operates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Court records show that in some cases, employees have changed sounds detected by the system to say that they are gunshots.\u003c/p>\u003cp>During 2016 testimony in a Rochester, New York, officer-involved shooting trial, ShotSpotter’s engineer Paul Greene was pressed to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The reason? He said its customer, in this case the Rochester Police Department, told them to.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The prosecutor in that case replied: “Is that something that occurs in the regular course of business at ShotSpotter?”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Yes, it is. It happens all the time,” said Greene. “Typically, you know, we trust our law enforcement customers to be really upfront and honest with us.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Testifying in a 2017 San Francisco murder trial, Greene gave similar testimony that an analyst had moved the location of its initial alert a block away, suddenly matching the scene of the crime.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s not perfect. The dot on the map is simply a starting point,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In the Williams case, evidence in pretrial hearings shows that ShotSpotter initially said the noise the sensor picked up was a firecracker, a classification the company’s algorithm made with 98% confidence. But a ShotSpotter employee relabeled the noise as a gunshot.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Later, ShotSpotter senior technical support engineer Walter Collier changed the reported Chicago address of the sound to the street where Williams was driving, about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away, according to court documents. ShotSpotter said Collier corrected the report to match the actual location that the sensors had identified. The company later provided AP with a copy of the full real-time alert, which contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates as did the second, detailed forensic analysis Collier prepared. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"social-embed\" id=\"se2:be6e25a0-f180-11eb-e39e-1ddc874bb682\">\u003ciframe title=\"The Traveling Gunshot\" aria-label=\"map\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-APN9W\" src=\"https://interactives.ap.org/embeds/APN9W/9/\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:none\" height=\"575\">\u003c/iframe>\u003cscript type=\"text/javascript\">!function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var e in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.getElementById(\"datawrapper-chart-\"+e)||document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\"+e+\"']\");t&&(t.style.height=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][e]+\"px\")}}))}();\u003c/script>\u003cp class=\"social-caption\">\u003c/p>\u003c/div>\u003cp>Collier worked for the Chicago Police Department for more than two decades before joining ShotSpotter, according to his LinkedIn profile.

The 79-year-old Vietnam veteran looked back from high on his bench and told Williams his case was dismissed. The reason: insufficient evidence.\u003c/p>\u003cp>ShotSpotter maintains it had warned prosecutors not to rely on its technology to detect gunshots fired inside vehicles or buildings.

The report itself contained contradictory information suggesting the technology did, in fact, work inside cars. Clark, the company’s CEO, declined to comment on the case, but in a follow-up statement, the company equivocated, telling AP that under “certain conditions,” the system can actually pick up gunshots inside vehicles.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Max, Williams’ attorney, said prosecutors never disclosed any of this information to him, and instead dropped charges two months after he subpoenaed ShotSpotter for the company’s correspondence with state’s attorneys.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The judge agreed to schedule a hearing in the coming weeks about whether to release ShotSpotter’s operating protocol and other documents the company wants to keep secret.

The Associated Press reported that a ShotSpotter engineer changed the reported Chicago address of a sound the company labeled a gunshot to the street where Michael Williams was driving. The story included ShotSpotter’s explanation that the engineer had corrected the street address that was generated in its initial real-time alert to match the actual street address that the company’s sensors had identified. The company has now provided the AP with a copy of the full real-time alert. The two reports the company issued – the initial real-time alert and the detailed forensic analysis later filed in court – contained a street address, location maps and latitude and longitude coordinates. The assigned street address changed from the first to the second report, but the location identified on the maps and GPS coordinates in both reports remained around the same intersection. ShotSpotter says the street address in the initial real-time alert sent to police was wrong because the GPS coordinates fell within a large park for which the officially designated address was about a mile away from the actual location identified by the sensors. In addition, the AP story misstated the status of an attorney who pressed a ShotSpotter engineer testifying in a trial to explain why one of its employees reclassified sounds from a helicopter to a bullet. The article said the attorney was a defense attorney but he was actually a prosecutor. The story also reported that in 2014, a judge in Richmond, California, didn’t allow ShotSpotter evidence to be used during a gang murder conspiracy case.

According to recent data from Mexico’s federal auditor, of more than 1,600 investigations into disappearances by authorities or cartels opened by the attorney general’s office, none made it to the courts in 2020.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Still, the work goes on at Nuevo Laredo.

They found a barrel tossed in a trough, shovels and an axe with traces of blood on it. Gunfire echoed in the distance. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Nearly six months later, there are still more than 30,000 square feet of property to inspect and catalog. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The house has been cleared, but four blackened spaces used for cremation remain. In what was the bathroom, it took the technicians three weeks to carefully excavate the compacted mass of human remains, concrete and melted tires, said Salinas, who leads work at the site. Grease streaks the walls.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Macías found the Nuevo Laredo house last August when he was looking for more than 70 people who had disappeared in the first half of the year along a stretch of highway connecting Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, the busiest trade crossing with the United States.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"afs:Content:566337904577\" class=\"hub-link-embed\">Full Coverage: Photography\u003c/div>\u003cp>The area was known as kilometer 26, a point on the highway and the invisible entrance to the kingdom of the Northeast cartel, a splinter of the Zetas. There are small shops with food and coffee. Men sell stolen gasoline and drugs. Strangers are filmed with cell phones. The power poles lining the highway farther north have been blasted with large-caliber weapons. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Most who disappeared here were truck drivers, cabbies, but also at least one family and various U.S. citizens. About a dozen have been found alive.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"944b6df1857a4d3a9d1a2bc7db13ab75\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"2bda523818c84bc9b051306599cb9202\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"33deff8b66e84bfeb6a4f83e5c6c79aa\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Last July, Karla Quintana, head of the National Search Commission, said the disappearances appeared to be related to a dispute between the Jalisco New Generation cartel, which was trying to enter the area, and the Northeast cartel, which wanted to keep them out. It’s not clear if the victims were smugglers of drugs or people, if some were abducted mistakenly or if the goal was simply to generate terror.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The phenomenon of Mexico’s disappearances exploded in 2006 when the government declared war on the drug cartels. For years, the government looked the other way as violence increased and families of the missing were forced to become detectives.\u003c/p>\u003cp>It wasn’t until 2018 -- the end of the last administration -- that a law passed, laying the legal foundations for the government to establish the National Search Commission. There followed local commissions in every state; protocols that separated searches from investigations, and a temporary and independent body of national and international technical experts supported by the U.N. to help clear the backlog of unidentified remains.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The official total of the missing stands at 98,356. Even without the civil wars or military dictatorships that afflicted other Latin American countries, Mexico’s disappeared are exceeded in the region only by war-torn Colombia. Unlike other countries, Mexico's challenge still has no end: authorities and families search for people who disappeared in the 1960s and those who went missing today. \u003c/p>\u003cp>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's government was the first to recognize the extent of the problem, to talk of “extermination sites” and to mount effective searches. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But he also promised in 2019 that authorities would have all the resources they needed. The national commission, which was supposed to have 352 employees this year, still has just 89. And Macías’ state commission has 22 positions budgeted, but has only filled a dozen slots. There the issue isn’t money; the difficulty is finding applicants who pass background checks.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Disappearances are considered the perfect crime because without a body, there’s no crime. And the cartels are expert at ensuring that there is no body.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“If a criminal group has total control of an area they do what we call ‘kitchens,’ because they feel comfortable” burning bodies openly, Macías said. “In areas that are not theirs and where the other side could easily see the smoke, they dig graves.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2009, at the other end of the border, a member of the Tijuana cartel confessed to having “cooked” some 300 victims in caustic lye. Eight years later, a report from a public university investigation center showed that what officially had been a jail in the border city of Piedras Negras, was actually a Zetas command center and crematorium.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"02732c3ec9a34b8b81e9b7b330c20136\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"9b6312cdb73c4ed6bcedfb3b2a1cae81\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cdiv id=\"8a87ee4bc27a4a37a53ef528af1a78c8\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Perhaps the largest such site was yet another border setting near the mouth of the Rio Grande called “the dungeon,” in territory controlled by the Gulf cartel. The memory still stirs Macías. The first time he went he saw “pelvis, skulls, femurs, everything just lying there and I said to myself, ‘It can’t be.’”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Authorities have recovered more than 1,100 pounds of bones at the site so far. \u003c/p>\u003cp>According to the Tamaulipas state forensic service, some 15 “extermination sites” have been found. There are also burial sites: In 2010, graves containing 191 bodies were found along one of the main migratory routes through Tamaulipas to the border. In 2014, 43 students disappeared in the southern state of Guerrero. Only three have been identified from pieces of burnt bones.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Most of the extermination sites have been found by family members who follow up leads themselves with or without the support and protection of authorities. Such search groups exist in nearly every state. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For the families, the discoveries inspire both hope and pain.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It brings together a lot of emotions,” said a woman who has been searching for her husband since 2014 and two brothers who disappeared later. Like thousands of relatives across Mexico, she has made the search for her loved ones her life. “It makes you happy to find (a site), but at the moment you see things the way they are, you nosedive.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The woman, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns, was present for the discovery of two sites last year. When she entered the Nuevo Laredo location with Macías, she could only cry.\u003c/p>\u003cp>A few months earlier, she had found the site in central Tamaulipas where she believes her loved ones are. That day, accompanied by the state search commission and escorted by the National Guard, they entered the brush in search of a drug camp.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“I’m not well psychologically after that,” she said as she showed photos of the deep graves where burnt remains were buried, some wrapped in barbed wire. They recovered around a thousand teeth, she said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>On a recent day in Nuevo Laredo, gloved hands sifted through the dirt, separating out bits of bone: a piece of a jaw, a skull fragment, a vertebra. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The work is hard. The forensic technicians clear brush and then dig. Some days the temperature hovers around freezing, others it’s above 100 degrees. They wear head-to-toe white protective suits and are constantly guarded. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Security is a concern, and so authorities have separated the search function from the investigations -- the cartels appear less concerned with those just looking for bones, though anything they find could eventually become evidence in a prosecution. Each day before dusk, they are escorted to a safe house and don’t leave except to return the next day to the site. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"517b7960451a4067a3b2276c3af02a4a\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>When cartel violence exploded in Tamaulipas in 2010, the capital’s morgue had space for six bodies. In a single massacre that year, a cartel killed 72 migrants. In those days, the Interamerican Commission of Human Rights denounced serious negligence in Tamaulipas’s forensic work. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pedro Sosa, director of the state’s forensic services, said that their way of working changed radically in 2018 with the establishment of the identification team. But it’s not enough. “A single forensic anthropologist in the whole state is not compatible with all of this work.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>It can take four months for the Nuevo Laredo remains to be cleaned, processed and arrive to the genetic lab. It can take longer if something urgent emerges like in January of last year, when nearly 20 people -- mostly migrants -- were incinerated in an attack near the border. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Even if they manage to extract DNA, identification isn’t assured because the profile will only automatically be crossed with a state database. \u003c/p>\u003cp>It could be years before the profile is added to one of the national databases.

It also illustrates the complexity and immensity of the challenges facing the country of nearly 1.4 billion people in meeting its renewable power goals for the next decade.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Over the next 20 years, India's demand for electricity will grow more than anywhere else in the world. Unlike most countries, India still has to develop and lift millions like Timungpi from poverty, and it will need to build a power system the size of the European Union’s. \u003c/p>\u003cp>How India meets its energy and economic needs will have an outsized impact on the world’s climate goals. The country is a major contributor of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at last year’s United Nation climate talks that India would increase its capacity of non-fossil fuels electricity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 — from the 104 gigawatts at the start of this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>To meet its goals, India must add four times the amount of power the average nuclear plant produces — every month until 2030.\u003c/p>\u003cp>These short-term energy targets won’t do much to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (34.7 Fahrenheit) — the level beyond which scientists warn of catastrophic climate impacts, scientists at last year's United Nations climate conference \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-scotland-environment-6d00fdae8c9b72c96b3beaf3b647e00d\">had warned\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>But for India, it’ll still be a “gargantuan task,” requiring investments between $20 billion and $26.8 billion, while only $10 billion is available, a parliamentary committee said last month. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Some obstacles to renewables — such as the need to build electricity storage for when the sun isn’t shining or wind isn’t blowing — are global challenges. Others are more specific to India — such as the question of who owns land in poor communities that bear least responsibility for the climate crisis and the need to realign power systems that have \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-business-india-europe-2a319a7c2df1a3fc2816d8e1f4aecf25\">relied on coal for centuries.\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>While there's no clear roadmap yet for India’s renewable energy push, experts cite a \u003ca href=\"https://cea.nic.in/old/reports/others/planning/irp/Optimal_mix_report_2029-30_FINAL.pdf\">federal report\u003c/a> last year that said an optimal mix would be getting more than half the country's power from the sun and wind by 2030.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But big solar and wind facilities are sparking conflicts with local communities. This is partly because land ownership is fuzzy at many project sites. For example, some communities have used land for centuries to farm or graze cattle without legal rights over it. \u003c/p>\u003cp>As governments and companies focused on transitioning away from fossil fuels, such conflicts were “collaterals” that had to be managed, Kanchi Kohli, an environmental researcher at the Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Mandatory environmental impact assessments were waived for solar and wind projects to make them more viable. But environmental issues still have arisen. \u003c/p>\u003cp>For instance, India’s Supreme Court in April 2021 ordered that transmission lines for solar energy be put underground after environmentalists reported the lines were killing critically endangered great Indian bustards. Nine months later, the federal government said burying the lines to safeguard the birds would be too costly and would impede green energy development. The court is hearing the matter again.\u003c/p>\u003cp>India could reduce its dependence on large solar parks by building solar panels on roofs in cities. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The country's initial rooftop goals were small, but in 2015 it set a target of 40 gigawatts of rooftop solar, enough to power 28 million homes. Customers were allowed to send electricity back to the grid — and the sector grew. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In December 2020, the federal government changed rules restricting large industries and businesses from sending electricity back to the grid. These commercial groups are among the highest paying customers for India’s perennially cash-strapped power distribution companies, which lost over $5 billion in 2020. \u003c/p>\u003cp>With industries sending electricity back to the grid in the evening when demand and power tariffs are highest, distribution companies were losing their best customers said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“They were losing money,” Garg said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The installation cost makes rooftop solar too expensive for most homeowners. That was the case for Siddhant Keshav, 30, a New Delhi entrepreneur, who wanted to put solar panels on his home. “It just didn’t make sense,” he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Homes comprised less than 17% of India's rooftop solar in June 2021, according to a report by Bridge to India, a renewable energy consulting firm. And India has only managed to achieve 4% of its 2022 rooftop solar target.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Wind could become another important element in India's clean energy portfolio. But the most “attractive, juicy, windy sites” have small turbines using old technology, said Gagan Sidhu, the director of energy finance at think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water. \u003c/p>\u003cp>By retiring old wind turbines built before 2002, India could unlock a capacity of 1.5 gigawatts, according to a 2017 \u003ca href=\"https://www.idaminfra.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Repowering-of-Old-Wind-Turbines-in-India.pdf\">study by Indo-Germany Energy Forum, the consulting firm Idam Infra and India’s renewable energy ministry\u003c/a>. But experts said it's unclear who would do the retrofitting and pay the bill.\u003c/p>\u003cp>With a coastline of over 4,670 miles (about 7,500 kilometers), India could potentially build enough offshore wind farms to provide roughly a third of the country's 2021 electricity capacity by 2050, according to an \u003ca href=\"https://mnre.gov.in/img/documents/uploads/88434488c99b46969eda9a0ecebeae2a.pdf\">assessment \u003c/a> led by the Global Wind Energy Council. \u003c/p>\u003cp>But these are very expensive to build — and the first such project, a wind farm proposed for the Arabian Sea in 2018, has yet to get underway.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ghosal reported from New Delhi.

Even though wind is blowing aloft, the cold air prevents the wind from getting down to ground level.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Just like an open top freezer in an old grocery store, that cold air just pools into the bottom of that freezer and air can just go right over the top,” said Bill Simpson, an atmospheric chemistry professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute and the UAF College of Natural Science and Mathematics. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“It’s calm down here, and the pollution that’s emitted down here stays down here, unfortunately,” added Simpson, the project leader.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id='fd0077a28c414dabb44a5dcb17155a66' class='media-placeholder'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>The problem isn’t unique to cold climates in the United States. The study is of interest to researchers in northern European cities because of the similar problems with inversions. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In Fairbanks, a major source of pollution comes from wood-burning stoves, which are common in this area where wood is plentiful and cheap, temperatures routinely reach minus 40 degrees F (minus 40 C) or colder and heating fuel is expensive. Other sources are vehicle exhaust systems, power plant emissions and heating oil. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Owen Hanley practiced pulmonary medicine in Fairbanks for about 35 years.

Meanwhile, a Swiss team used a tethered balloon, equipped with specialized instruments, to measure characteristics of aerosols and different trace gases at 1,200 feet (365 meters) above the ground. Another instrument allowed them to measure vertical profiles of the atmosphere.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We are trying to understand what is happening higher up\" because ground level data can be different, said Roman Pohorsky, a doctoral student at the EPFL, a science and technology institution in Switzerland.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another experiment led by Sarah Johnson, a graduate student and researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles, used a special device to measure trace gases or pollutants at different heights in the atmosphere. The instrument, called a Long Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer, collects information by beaming light from a parking garage to reflectors set at different heights in Fairbanks, and then studying the information that comes back. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“What we’re really looking for is information about where the pollution is accumulating as well as where it’s going,” she said, adding that she hopes the research can benefit other areas with similar weather and dirty air. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Another goal of the research came from members of the Fairbanks community: People wanted to know what the air is like inside their homes.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Researchers took over a house in Fairbanks, setting up shop in the garage with tubes running from both inside the house and outside to study the air.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ellis Robinson, a post-doctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, noted that most public health information about the dangers of air pollution comes from studying outdoor air. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“But we really need to be studying indoor air, just as much if not more,” said Robinson. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Sulfur can be a major pollutant for people who use heating oil in their houses or live near coal-fired power plants. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Scientists are working to better understand how the sulfur that’s emitted, mostly as a gas, sulfur dioxide, turns into particles in colder and darker locations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While the research is not a formal regulatory project, Simpson, the project leader, said the team would be willing to share the results with the EPA, the agency charged with determining Clean Air Act violations. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The Fairbanks area has been out of compliance with air quality standards since 2009. The EPA is reviewing the state of Alaska's latest plan to bring the borough into compliance. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The researchers are expected to deliver the findings back to the university by late summer. The results will be shared with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, Fairbanks' air quality division and with residents, who will have the chance to weigh in on possible solutions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“We can compare and contrast those situations and try and build a set of kind of best practices for understanding how pollution works in cold and dark places,” Simpson said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press climate and environmental coverage receives support from several private foundations.

We have more bull’s eyes on the dartboard. We have more cities. We have more weak frame housing stock. Tornadoes happen more often there at night, which is exactly what we saw last night.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory, said traditional 20th century tornadoes, the type that make Oklahoma and Kansas famous, are less deadly because they go for miles without anything in the way. In 1991, he and his wife chased for 66 miles a tornado in Oklahoma that had winds hit 286 mph. It hit two barns; no one but a few cows were hurt.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Put that storm near New Orleans at night and dozens of people would be killed, probably many more. In the Southeast “all it takes is a weather event to occur and you’ll have people in the way,” Brooks said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>DOES CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE A ROLE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>In 2018, Brooks and Gensini \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mo-state-wire-ar-state-wire-in-state-wire-ia-state-wire-mississippi-river-9ddb3deeec9a49d6a1349b78f1ca0f03\">published a scientific study \u003c/a> showing deadly tornadoes were happening less frequently in the tornado alley of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and more frequently in “tornado fatality alley, which is the Mid-South,” Gensini said.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\" data='autoembed'>\u003c/div>\u003cp>What’s likely happening is that the West is \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-science-west-megadrought-f02449c2db4f0ebeb1557bb39504c62d\">getting drier\u003c/a> because of human-caused \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/climate\">climate change,\u003c/a> which makes it harder for the air to become moist and unstable, which is crucial for tornado formation, they said. The Southeast is getting warmer air, which holds more water vapor, which creates that important instability, Gensini said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Climate models predict this type shift 50 years in the future or so, yet it appears to be happening now, Gensini said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But Gensini, Brooks and University of Ohio meteorology professor Jana Houser emphasized that they don’t see a climate change signal in Tuesday’s deadly Louisiana tornado.\u003c/p>\u003cp>There’s a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-science-droughts-weather-el-nino-a0356e631b84929e3155c3d3eb956c51\">La Nina,\u003c/a> a natural periodic cooling of parts of the Pacific that shifts global weather patterns, and that usually means more tornadoes in the Southeast because of changes in the jet stream and moisture, they said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT NIGHT TORNADOES ?\u003c/p>\u003cp>Tuesday’s nighttime tornado illustrated a problem because when twisters hit at night, people can’t see them coming as easily and often don’t react as well, the tornado experts said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About three-quarters of the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and other Great Plains states occur between 5 and 9 p.m. so people know when to expect them and its more daylight, Brooks said. But in the Southeast they can hit any time, which means more often at night than in Oklahoma, making them more dangerous.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Another reason they happen more at night in the Southeast is because they happen more in the springtime and there are just fewer daylight hours, Gensini said. Spring storms are juicier and stronger than summer ones so they don’t need the sun’s daytime heat to add that extra kick of energy to spur tornadoes, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>WHAT ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Southeast is also hurt by having more trees, hills and buildings that block people’s views of incoming storms.\u003c/p>\u003cp>When there’s a tornado warning in the Southeast, often people are “out to their front porch and they don’t really see anything, and it just kind of looks like, you know, a dark sky,” Houser said. “They may be less likely to actually heed those warnings than if they are walking out their door and they see a tornado on the horizon, even if it’s far away. So there’s a little bit of geography that plays a role there.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>ANY GOOD NEWS FOR THE REGION?\u003c/p>\u003cp>The one advantage tornadoes in the Southeast have is that they are easier for meteorologists to forecast the conditions ripe for bad outbreaks much earlier. Tuesday’s severe storm was warned about eight days in advance by NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center, which is unusual, Brooks said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Read more of AP’s climate coverage at \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/Climate\">http://www.apnews.com/Climate\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Follow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/borenbears\">@borenbears\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>","alertLinkDateTime":null,"storyLayout":{},"reporters":[],"headlinePlacement":null,"relatedStoryEmbeds":[],"disableNativo":false}],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":null,"expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[],"headlineWidget":false,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":null,"hubPeekTagName":null,"hubPeekCanonicalName":null,"hubPeekIsPr":null,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"Climate","name":"Climate","canonicalName":"climate","isPr":false},{"id":"Tornadoes","name":"Tornadoes","canonicalName":"tornadoes","isPr":false},{"id":"Storms","name":"Storms","canonicalName":"storms","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-science","name":"Science","canonicalName":"science","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-topnews","name":"AP Top News","canonicalName":"ap-top-news","isPr":false},{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},{"id":"Environmentandnature","name":"Environment and nature","canonicalName":"environment-and-nature","isPr":false},{"id":"NewOrleans","name":"New Orleans","canonicalName":"new-orleans","isPr":false},{"id":"Weather","name":"Weather","canonicalName":"weather","isPr":false},{"id":"Kansas","name":"Kansas","canonicalName":"kansas","isPr":false}],"textColor":null,"layoutType":null,"customLayoutType":null,"styleName":null,"endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null}],"headlineWidget":null,"hubPeekLinkText":null,"hubPeekTagId":"Climate","hubPeekTagName":"Climate","hubPeekCanonicalName":"climate","hubPeekIsPr":false,"minimizedStoryCount":null,"tagObjs":[{"id":"APVideos","name":"AP Videos","canonicalName":"ap-videos","isPr":false}],"textColor":"#000000","layoutType":"Feature","customLayoutType":"null","styleName":"Feature","endDateTime":null,"teamLimit":25,"medalCounts":null,"medalsUpdated":null,"notificationUrl":null,"notificationText":null,"notificationTitle":null,"notificationType":null,"notificationUpdated":null,"adUnits":null},{"id":"afs:Card:060162638349","shortId":"afs:Card:060162638349","allowAd":true,"borderColor":"#000000","brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":"U.S. News","cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Hub Peek","collectionTagObjs":{"id":"apf-usnews","name":"U.S. News","canonicalName":"us-news","isPr":false},"contents":[],"disclaimerText":null,"dividerColor":"#000000","expandedStoryCount":null,"feed":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4b7ffebe528a5720b192766f89b5497c","shortId":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4b7ffebe528a5720b192766f89b5497c","allowAd":true,"borderColor":null,"brackets":null,"bracketsSettings":null,"cardTitle":null,"cardHeadline":null,"cardType":"Wire Story","collectionTagObjs":null,"contents":[{"id":"urn:publicid:ap.org:4b7ffebe528a5720b192766f89b5497c","shortId":"4b7ffebe528a5720b192766f89b5497c","bylines":"By PATRICK WHITTLE","canonicalUrl":"2022-midterm-elections-covid-business-health-california","contentType":"text","disableConnatix":false,"downloadSettings":{},"embedCaption":null,"embedHeight":null,"embedHTML":null,"embedLinkURL":null,"firstWords":"\u003cp>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — With inflation raging and state coffers flush with cash, governors and lawmakers across the U.S. are considering a relatively simple solution to help ease the pain people are feeling at the gas pump and grocery store — sending money.\u003c/p>","hasTextOverlay":false,"headline":"US states seek to ease inflation burden with direct payments","description":null,"interactiveLinkUrl":null,"interactiveLinkUrlText":null,"language":"en","leadPhotoId":"961a7414e1f34f728c4e5d7def6e31d4","leadVideoId":null,"localLinkUrl":"https://apnews.com/4b7ffebe528a5720b192766f89b5497c","localMemberName":null,"media":[{"id":"961a7414e1f34f728c4e5d7def6e31d4","type":"Photo","caption":"\u003cp>Wayne Holly, the owner of Rio Rancho T-Shirts, poses for a portrait at the family-owned shop in Rio Rancho, N.M., Monday, March 21, 2022.

Maine's governor's race is one of many closely watched contests at the state level this year.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“There's some real policy reason to do this,\" Brewer said. \"But at the same time, it's also clear that this is an election year, and in an election year there are few things as popular as giving voters what voters see as free money from the state.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>The states are moving toward sending people money as consumer inflation has jumped nearly 8% over the past year.

Measures enacted by presidents Donald Trump in 2020 and Joe Biden last year allotted a combined total of more than $500 billion to state and local governments. Some of that is still sitting in state coffers waiting to be spent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Those federal pandemic relief laws also provided stimulus checks to U.S. taxpayers, which helped boost consumer spending on goods subject to state and local sales taxes. From April 2021 to January 2022, total state tax revenues, adjusted for inflation, increased more than 19% compared to the same period a year earlier, according to a recent Urban Institute report. \u003c/p>\u003cp>“Overall, the fiscal condition of states is strong, and much better than where we thought states would be at the start of the pandemic,” said Erica MacKellar, a fiscal policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That’s given state officials greater confidence to consider tax rebates or direct payments to residents. But some financial experts are urging caution, noting that inflation also could drive up state expenses and wages.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“State legislatures should not rush into enacting permanent tax cuts based on what very well might be temporary growth in real revenues,” Lucy Dadayan, senior research associate at the Urban Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The relief plans vary by state. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, released a plan for spending the state's \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-minnesota-personal-taxes-jesse-ventura-7e9f1382d646ac1d678bfcc6beba99c8\">budget surplus that included a proposal for income tax rebate checks of $1,000 per couple. \u003c/a> In California, Democratic lawmakers have released separate proposals to send rebates of $200 to $400 to each taxpayer, while Gov. Gavin Newsom said \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-california-gavin-newsom-32d6a22310870ab49c14c4dbe6cb586d\"> he wants to distribute fuel debit cards of up to $800\u003c/a> to help ease the burden on residents paying the highest gas prices in the nation.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Democratic governors in other states have proposed other approaches. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is seeking \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/business-pennsylvania-legislature-child-care-tom-wolf-4904c08cc15e8b026f742b406bbeb723\">a one-time property tax subsidy for lower-income homeowners and renters. \u003c/a> In Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker has proposed halting a 2.2-cent increase in the motor fuel tax, suspending a 1% grocery sales tax for a year and providing a property tax rebate of up to $300.\u003c/p>\u003cp>New Jersey got out front early. Gov. Phil Murphy and the Democrat-led Legislature included cash checks of up to $500 to about 1 million families as part of a budget deal last year, when the governor and lawmakers were up for election.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The state’s rosy financial picture, fueled by healthy tax receipts and federal funds -- as well as higher taxes on people making $1 million — has continued this year. But Murphy’s fiscal year 2023 budget doesn’t call for additional cash rebates.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Proposals for relief haven't gone so smoothly in other states. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, has proposed returning half of a $90 million surplus in the state Education Fund to the state’s property taxpayers with a check of between $250 and $275, but the Democrat-controlled Legislature has shown little interest.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Typically, when you overpay for something, you get some of that money back,” Scott said when he made the proposal earlier this month.\u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press writers Susan Montoya Bryan in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Mike Catalini in Trenton, New Jersey; David A.

Though the organizations relocated events from North Carolina in 2016 after lawmakers limited which public restrooms transgender people could use, the states that have passed bans on transgender student-athletes have \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-news-health-laws-legislature-bills-5726fdeb8a5e7cf2c89a4a2d176e8a7f\">generally not faced \u003c/a> similar backlash. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Pushback has come from social conservatives, though.

Republican Arizona Gov.
