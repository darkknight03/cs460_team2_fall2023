<dd>
<p>Sam Schechner and Tim Higgins, reporting last week for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AjwI1hwp9RISCJiqgGwEvVQ">News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new European Union legislation — which could be effectively
completed as soon as this month — is set to direct Apple to allow
software to be downloaded outside its cash-generating App Store
and limit how companies impose their own payment systems on apps,
according to people involved in the negotiations. Failure to
comply would carry penalties of up to tens of billions of dollars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not the sort of fines Apple can just pay from the loose change in Luca Maestri’s couch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rivals and critics of Apple’s power hope the EU law will serve as
a catalyst for other jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., where
similar legislation is pending before Congress.</p>

<p>“Apple is playing 5D chess right now,” said Paul Gallant, a policy
analyst for Cowen &amp; Co. “It will struggle to explain why
government changes will radically change the iPhone when Google
already does it and it will struggle to explain why it can’t do it
in the United States when it may soon do it in Europe.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a dumb quote. First, what the hell is the fifth dimension? It’s like he was going to say “4D chess” — which itself is a poor metaphor, given that regular chess is complex enough and takes place in two dimensions — and decided to give it some extra oomph. Second, the iPhone <em>is</em> different from Android. It is true that the fact that Android supports sideloading doesn’t seem to adversely affect typical Android users, but one of Apple’s core arguments against legally mandated sideloading is that it would remove from the market a choice to buy devices where sideloading is not possible. Third, no one from Apple has ever once argued that they “can’t” enable sideloading on iOS because that’s obviously nonsense. They don’t want to enable it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full effect of the sideloading provision isn’t yet clear as
lawmakers work on final language defining security exceptions that
could give Apple leeway to limit the scope of sideloading.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s really the rub.</p>

<p>Eliot A. Cohen, writing for The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The evidence that Ukraine is winning this war is abundant, if one
only looks closely at the available data. The absence of Russian
progress on the front lines is just half the picture, obscured
though it is by maps showing big red blobs, which reflect not what
the Russians control but the areas through which they have driven.
The failure of almost all of Russia’s airborne assaults, its
inability to destroy the Ukrainian air force and air-defense
system, and the weeks-long paralysis of the 40-mile supply column
north of Kyiv are suggestive. Russian losses are staggering — between 7,000 and 14,000 soldiers dead, depending on your source,
which implies (using a low-end rule of thumb about the ratios of
such things) a minimum of nearly 30,000 taken off the battlefield
by wounds, capture, or disappearance. Such a total would represent
at least 15 percent of the entire invading force, enough to render
most units combat ineffective. And there is no reason to think
that the rate of loss is abating — in fact, Western intelligence
agencies <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/20/russia-ukraine-military-offensive/">are briefing</a> unsustainable Russian casualty rates of
a thousand a day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was instrumental in prodding Tandy to venture into the computer
market. At the time, most small computers were sold as kits to be
assembled by hobbyists, but Mr. Roach believed that consumers
would welcome a model that they just needed to plug in.</p>

<p>His team presented the original TRS-80 prototype — cobbled
together from a black-and-white RCA monitor, a keyboard and a
videocassette recorder — to Tandy’s chief executive, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/06/archives/charles-tandy-60-industrialist-started-work-at-12-400-radio-shacks.html">Charles
Tandy</a>, and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/lewis-kornfeld-made-radio-shack-an-early-player-in-pcs-dies-at-97.html">Lewis Kornfeld</a>, the president of
RadioShack, in January 1977.</p>

<p>The Apple 1 had been introduced the year before, and Commodore and
other companies were marketing their own home computers, but the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/25/archives/com-puters-find-a-home-yours-the-computer-finds-a-home-yours.html">TRS-80</a> (the initials stood for Tandy RadioShack) quickly
became, for a time, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/04/garden/doing-the-homework.html">the most popular computer on the market</a>.</p>

<p>“Charles blew a little smoke and said, ‘Build a thousand and if we
can’t sell them, we will use them in the store for something,’”
Mr. Roach recalled in remarks to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWmYOzm16E">Fort Worth Executive Round
Table</a> last month. “We were finally able to ship some machines
in September and shipped 5,000 that year, all we could assemble,”
Mr. Roach said. “Our competitors shipped none.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The links in the passage above are not to be missed, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1977/08/25/archives/com-puters-find-a-home-yours-the-computer-finds-a-home-yours.html">this 1977 Times story on home computers</a>. But the last one is the most interesting — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRWmYOzm16E">it’s a YouTube video of a speech Roach gave just last month</a>. He’s funny as hell. Glad to see he was active and sharp right up to the end.</p>

<p>As a kid, the TRS-80 was, for whatever reason, the personal computer I had the least exposure to. I had friends with Commodore 64’s and my school had a bunch of Texas Instruments TI-99/4A’s and a precious handful of Apple II’s, but to my recollection I only ever saw a TRS-80 when I was inside a Radio Shack. But you can be damn sure when I did, I played with it until my parents dragged me out of the store.</p>

</dt>
<dd>
<p>Juli Clover, writing for MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The full report is limited to those in the display industry who
subscribe, but display analyst Ross Young provided a bit of color
on what can be expected. Apple is working on a MacBook Air that’s
somewhere around 15 inches in size, with the machine set to debut
alongside a “slightly larger” 13-inch MacBook Air.</p>

<p>According to Young, the larger-sized 15-inch MacBook Air is slated
for release in 2023, but a specific launch date unknown. This is
not the first time that we’ve heard about a 15-inch MacBook Air,
as Bloomberg’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/23/apple-developing-15-inch-macbook-air/">Mark Gurman said last year</a> that Apple was
working on a larger MacBook Air with a 15-inch display size. [...]</p>

<p>Internal Apple emails that came out during the Epic Games
v. Apple trial also indicate that Apple considered a larger
15-inch MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/mac-tablet-larger-macbook-air-ipod-super-nano/">as early as 2008</a>, but instead went
with the smaller 13-inch model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of all the devices Apple could make but doesn’t, the one that I think might prove the most popular is a big consumer MacBook. Apple has never made a 15-inch or larger laptop that wasn’t a pro-specced and pro-priced MacBook Pro or PowerBook. Surely there are a lot of people out there who would buy a MacBook Air with a 15-inch display if one existed. Plus, now that <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/10/the_2021_14-inch_macbook_pro">the latest MacBook Pros have gained a wee bit of thickness and weight</a> in the interest of better serving pro users’ needs, there’s room for a thinner, lighter large-display MacBook to stand out. But why wait for 2023? I’d love to see such a thing appear later this year, when M2 MacBooks are unveiled.</p>

<p>The current MacBook Air (13 inches) starts at $1000. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2000. The 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at $2500. So the missing MacBook is a 15-inch MacBook Air that starts at $1500. There must be some number of 16-inch MacBook Pro buyers who really do buy them <em>just</em> to get the big display, and they’d spend around $1000 less if a large-display consumer MacBook were available. But I can’t help but think Apple could make up for the lost revenue from those customers by upselling more MacBook Air buyers on a larger screen.</p>

<p>“The largest display option is only available in the pro models” is true for iPads and iPhones too, of course. But <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">rumors strongly suggest</a> that the iPhone 14 will appear with 6.1- and 6.7-inch sizes in both the Pro and non-Pro models. A big-screen non-Pro MacBook would follow that same pattern.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Thursday, 24 March 2022</h6>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/03/google-routinely-hides-emails-from-litigation-by-ccing-attorneys-doj-alleges/">Jon Brodkin, writing for Ars Technica</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The US Department of Justice and 14 state attorneys general
yesterday asked a federal judge to sanction Google for misusing
attorney-client privilege to hide emails from litigation.</p>

<p>“In a program called ‘Communicate with Care,’ Google trains and
directs employees to add an attorney, a privilege label, and a
generic ‘request’ for counsel’s advice to shield sensitive
business communications, regardless of whether any legal advice is
actually needed or sought. Often, knowing the game, the in-house
counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not
respond at all,” the DOJ told the court. The fact that attorneys
often don’t reply to the emails “underscor[es] that these
communications are not genuine requests for legal advice but
rather an effort to hide potential evidence,” the DOJ said. [...]</p>

<p>CCing lawyers is a <a href="https://www.todaysgeneralcounsel.com/to-cc-or-not-to-cc-that-is-the-privilege-question/">common
practice</a>,
but the DOJ says Google took it to an “egregious” level. “Google’s
institutionalized manufacturing of false privilege claims is
egregious, spanning nearly a decade and permeating the company
from the top executives on down,” the DOJ said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without commenting on Google’s program or the specifics of the DOJ’s accusations, the broader issue makes me think about the nature of digital communication. Pre-email, business communication between colleagues was typically either in-person (not recorded), on the phone (not recorded), or via printed memoranda and reports (recorded, on paper). During a legal inquiry, printed memos could be subpoenaed or subject to discovery, and phone records could too. But telephone records only show who called whom, when, and for how long. The content of phone calls wasn’t (and still isn’t) recorded.</p>

<p>Email corresponds directly to the form of printed memos. That’s even where email lingo like “CC” and using a “Subject” line comes from. (“CC” originally stood for “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carbon%20copy">carbon copy</a>”, which is how those copies were actually made — using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_paper">carbon paper</a>.) Emails are seemingly just like paper memos, only digital. But, because email is so much more profoundly convenient to use, both to send and receive, it quickly became more casual. Psychologically, using email for work <em>feels</em> a lot more like face-to-face conversations or phone calls. Many people with office jobs send thousands of emails per year at work. Only a maniac sent out thousands of printed memos per year pre-email.</p>

<p>I don’t think you have to be doing something immoral or on shaky legal footing to want to communicate with colleagues privately, without fear of those communications being exposed in future legal inquiries. Any sort of strategic deliberation is something you’d naturally want to remain forever private. So I get the basic desire. But I think a loose policy of just cc’ing company attorneys on we-want-this-to-remain-private emails is a poor strategy. The emails are still there. And the DOJ and state attorneys general can look at this behavior, see that the lawyers aren’t really involved in the discussions, and raise a stink about it, as they have with Google. Whatever the contents of those emails, this “Communicate With Care” program <em>looks</em> shady.</p>

<p>Last year, writing about a Phil Schiller email that was made public through discovery in the Epic v. Apple lawsuit, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut#fn1-2021-06-07">I asked a question in a footnote</a>:<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-24"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-24">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It really has all been email, too. Unless I’m missing something,
not one piece of communication entered into evidence — from
either Apple or Epic — has been anything other than an email
message. Not one message from iMessage or any other messaging
service. I find that very surprising. Do Apple executives never
use iMessage to discuss work? Nor Epic’s? If anyone with legal
expertise can explain why this is, let me know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I got a few answers from readers. Basically, there’s little that would stop either side in a lawsuit from demanding access to private messages from services like iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, etc. In criminal investigations, of course, law enforcement often does attempt to obtain such messages — law enforcement tries to obtain <em>everything</em>. But in many civil proceedings there’s an unspoken gentleperson’s agreement not to pursue such messages through discovery, being deemed too broad, too personal, too invasive. Technically, there’s a big difference between these services and email. Email is stored unencrypted on a server. The aforementioned messaging services are end-to-end encrypted. You’d have to get them from the individual parties’ devices — presuming they weren’t deleted.</p>

<p>So what I don’t get about Google’s “Communicate With Care” policy is why it involves email at all. Why not a policy recommending against using email, period, for anything deemed confidential? I get that Google is in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">a uniquely awkward position</a> regarding post-email messaging services, but how about just using a service other than email that’s end-to-end encrypted? Or discussing all such matters in person or over voice? Part of me thinks this “Communicate With Care” policy at Google is just arrogant, but more than that, I think it’s just foolishly stubborn. If you don’t want it discovered, don’t put it in email.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2009/12/google-ceo-eric-schmidt-dismisses-privacy">as Eric Schmidt himself once advised</a>, “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.”&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The D.O.J.

<p>Speaking of footnotes, post-publication, a friend pointed me to at least one iMessage exchange that <em>was</em> entered into evidence in Epic v. Apple — exhibit PX-0276, between Apple employees Herve Sibert and Eric Friedman. I can’t find a link online, but it was part of a trove of evidence that was briefly hosted on Box.com during the trial. I’ll host <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/PX-0276.pdf">a copy of the PDF here</a>.

<blockquote>
  <p>If anyone reads that New Yorker article and thinks they’ll prefer
shooting on an iPhone 7, please show them these iPhone 7-vs-12

</blockquote>

<p>That’s a reference to Kyle Chayka’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/have-iphone-cameras-become-too-smart">Have iPhone Cameras Become Too Smart?</a>” article, which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/22/chayka-iphone-smart">I commented on yesterday</a>. It’s coincidental that Nack’s year-ago series of comparison photos pitted the same two iPhones against each other that Chayka referenced. Chayka wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January, I traded my iPhone 7 for an iPhone 12 Pro, and I’ve
been dismayed by the camera’s performance. On the 7, the slight
roughness of the images I took seemed like a logical product of
the camera’s limited capabilities. I didn’t mind imperfections
like the “digital noise” that occurred when a subject was underlit
or too far away, and I liked that any editing of photos was up to
me. On the 12 Pro, by contrast, the digital manipulations are
aggressive and unsolicited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of times when new iPhones are reviewed — including my own reviews — camera comparisons are made to iPhones from just one or two years prior, and differences can seem subtle. Separate iPhones by five years, though, and the results are striking. (It’s pretty easy to tell in Nack’s gallery which photos are from which iPhone, but if you want to be certain, click the “(i)” button in Google Photos.)</p>

<p>How do you take a photo like <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/7a69Jw8TdGXALPJYly0EFI">this</a> or <a href="https://glass.photo/gruber/1SQdgEk3GMbycs0zdKYH0J">this</a> — to pick two of my own recent photos taken with iPhone 13 Pro — with an iPhone 7? You can’t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Building on our recent launch allowing an <a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html">additional billing
system</a> alongside Play’s billing for users in South Korea and
in line with our <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/how-sustain-safe-thriving-app-and-game-ecosystem/">principles</a>, we are announcing we will be
exploring user choice billing in other select countries. This
pilot will allow a small number of participating developers to
offer an additional billing option next to Google Play’s billing
system and is designed to help us explore ways to offer this
choice to users, while maintaining our ability to invest in the
ecosystem.</p>

<p>We’ll be partnering with developers to explore different
implementations of user-choice billing, <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-03-23/spotify-and-google-announce-user-choice-billing">starting with
Spotify</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-03-23/spotify-and-google-announce-user-choice-billing">Spotify’s own announcement</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spotify has been publicly advocating for platform fairness and
expanded payment options, among other things, because fair and
open platforms enable better consumer experiences and allow
developers to grow and thrive — when this happens everyone wins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gee, I wonder which platforms — there are so many that Spotify really cares about — they consider unfair.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/23/google-play-to-pilot-third-party-billing-option-globally-starting-with-spotify/">Sarah Perez, reporting for TechCrunch on the deal</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reached for comment, Spotify declined to say what sort of
commission it would be paying Google as a part of this pilot test,
noting that the agreement was confidential. But a company
spokesperson suggested that the commercial terms met Spotify’s
“standards of fairness.”</p>

<p>Google also declined to detail the commission structure involved.
However, it noted that user choice billing, such as is the case in
South Korea, will still involve a service fee regardless of which
billing system the user chooses.</p>

<p>I’ve been greatly enjoying Nilay Patel’s Decoder podcast, no episode more so than this recent interview with Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton. The recurring theme: general purpose computers vs. appliance computers. And my favorite line from Upton, neatly summarizing Raspberry Pi’s ethos: “We build the products we want to buy.”</p>

<p>My <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/23/systemsix">aforelinked item</a> on <a href="https://www.engineersneedart.com/systemsix/systemsix.html">John Calhoun’s “SystemSix”</a> project is a perfect example of Raspberry Pi’s general purpose utility and affordability. If Raspberry Pi didn’t exist, there are of course ways Calhoun <em>could</em> have built something similar, but I doubt he <em>would</em> have.</p>

<p>John Calhoun:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SystemSix is a desk calendar that displays the weather forecast
and phase of the moon on an e-ink display. This is a kind of
love-letter to my first Macintosh.</p>

<p>It’s powered by a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 3</a>. The display is <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/5.83inch-e-paper.htm">5.83″ e-ink
display</a> from <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/">Waveshare</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you configure it to point to a public calendar it will fetch
the next six calendar events and display them (see below, the
events are the folder names in the window in “list view”).</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your latitude and longitude in the settings and it
will fetch the local weather forecast (see below, being displayed
in the Scrapbook).</p></li>
<li><p>In the evening SystemSix displays the current phase of the moon
(see below, looking like a “desk accessory” in vintage-Mac
parlance).</p></li>
<li><p>The trash icon is displayed “full” on the day of your choice
(for me it’s Monday, to remind me to take the trash to the curb
for Tuesday pickup).</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>There are two rubs. First, it’s not an interactive classic Mac emulator. It looks like a Mac, but it’s just a static dashboard that <em>looks like</em> a classic Mac. Second, Calhoun built this for himself as a project. It is not, alas, a product for sale.</p>

<p>Future ideas:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m happy with this project. It satisfied both my curiosity about
e-ink displays and Python as well as rekindled fond memories for
the early Mac. There’s plenty more I can do with this though. I
mentioned already that there are a number of “layouts” left still
to implement like a Hypercard layout or two. I also got
screenshots for potential layouts of an install in progress,
KeyCaps, a print panel, Chooser, etc.</p>

<p>Nicole Nguyen, writing for The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://apple.news/AphfjzphCQm6vHqkYb-fQ0w">News+</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, I wanted to compare 5G and 4G battery performance for myself.
I streamed a long YouTube video of relaxing ocean footage, with
video quality set to “Auto,” on different Apple devices until they
ran out of battery, first on 5G, then on LTE. It isn’t a perfect
test, but it proved to be a consistent way to witness 5G’s added
battery drain. [...]</p>

<p>The new SE lasted nearly an hour longer on 4G than on 5G, while
the new iPad Air and iPhone 13 Mini went for about 1.5 additional
hours. And while the iPhone 13 Pro ran a remarkable 12 hours and
50 minutes on 5G, it still lasted about 2.5 hours longer on LTE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nguyen includes a tip at the end of her column explaining how to create a simple Shortcuts automation to switch cellular networking to LTE when your device’s battery hits a certain threshold, like say 40 percent. But I look at these results and wonder why I enable 5G at all. There is nothing I do with my iPhone — nothing — where I find LTE even just a little bit “too slow”.</p>

<p>I wrote about 5G, including mmWave “ultra wideband”, networking speeds <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_iphone_12_and_iphone_12_pro#5g">in my review of the iPhones 12 and 12 Pro</a> back in October 2020. Verizon’s ultra wideband network speeds are truly extraordinary — I still typically get 1,500–2,000 Mbps down with 5G ultra wideband. With both regular 5G and LTE, I typically get between 50–100 Mbps down — and I see a regular 5G connection far far more often than I do 5G ultra wideband. I don’t see any practical advantage to regular 5G compared to LTE. Those crazy-fast ultra-wideband download speeds are like owning a car that can go 200 MPH. So I’m just going to set my iPhone to use LTE all the time and save battery life. I’ll turn 5G Auto back on if I ever run into a situation where my LTE signal seems weak or slow.</p>

<p>The carriers certainly aren’t going to suggest you do this because their current marketing campaigns are entirely about how great their 5G networks are — even though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22968066/apple-iphone-se-5g-mmwave-verizon-uw">they’re only now starting to deliver meaningful real-world advantages over LTE</a>. And Apple’s not going to suggest you turn off 5G either, because they are co-marketing partners with the carriers. But I’ll suggest it: try turning off 5G to save battery life and see if you miss it at all.</p>

<p>Microsoft Security:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The activity we have observed has been attributed to a threat
group that Microsoft tracks as DEV-0537, also known as LAPSUS$.
DEV-0537 is known for using a pure extortion and destruction model
without deploying ransomware payloads. DEV-0537 started targeting
organizations in the United Kingdom and South America but expanded
to global targets, including organizations in government,
technology, telecom, media, retail, and healthcare sectors.
DEV-0537 is also known to take over individual user accounts at
cryptocurrency exchanges to drain cryptocurrency holdings.</p>

<p>Unlike most activity groups that stay under the radar, DEV-0537
doesn’t seem to cover its tracks. They go as far as announcing
their attacks on social media or advertising their intent to buy
credentials from employees of target organizations. DEV-0537 also
uses several tactics that are less frequently used by other threat
actors tracked by Microsoft. Their tactics include phone-based
social engineering; SIM-swapping to facilitate account takeover;
accessing personal email accounts of employees at target
organizations; paying employees, suppliers, or business partners
of target organizations for access to credentials and multifactor
authentication (MFA) approval; and intruding in the ongoing
crisis-communication calls of their targets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scroll down, and they acknowledge having been exploited themselves this week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week, the actor made public claims that they had gained
access to Microsoft and exfiltrated portions of source code. No
customer code or data was involved in the observed activities. Our
investigation has found a single account had been compromised,
granting limited access. Our cybersecurity response teams quickly
engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent further
activity. Microsoft does not rely on the secrecy of code as a
security measure and viewing source code does not lead to
elevation of risk. The tactics DEV-0537 used in this intrusion
reflect the tactics and techniques discussed in this blog. Our
team was already investigating the compromised account based on
threat intelligence when the actor publicly disclosed their
intrusion. This public disclosure escalated our action allowing
our team to intervene and interrupt the actor mid-operation,
limiting broader impact.</p>

  <p>Today, Nothing is releasing a series of images of Nothing OS, the
Android skin it plans to ship on the Phone 1. The images don’t
reveal much about what the software might be able to do, but Pei
is keen to emphasize its look, which very consciously lines up
with the rest of Nothing’s branding. The interface is a sea of
black, white, and red that leans heavily on the dotted font that
Nothing uses for its logo.</p>

<p>Pei’s also very into the sound of the phone, an area he thinks is
often overlooked. “Our sound design is really cool,” he says, “so
definitely check that out.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m going to offer a working definition for the purposes of this
essay: “cancel culture” is when speech is met with a response
that, in my opinion, is very disproportionate. Perhaps that sounds
cynical, and I could certainly give you a
Justice-Breyer-seven-factor balancing test, but that’s what this
discussion boils down to: just as we constantly debate norms of
what speech is socially acceptable, we debate norms about what
responses to speech are socially acceptable. […]</p>

<p>Why should we care about having a serious discussion about
defining cancel culture? We should because simply complaining
about it in the abstract, without attempts to define it, without
actionable responses, and without taking the rights of
“cancellers” doesn’t ease the culture war. It inflames it.</p>

<p>I loved this entire piece, but the above encapsulates my thinking on the term “cancel culture” perfectly.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/22/workflow-shortcuts-five-years">Speaking of automation</a>, here’s an update near and dear to my regex-loving heart. Daniel Jalkut, writing at the Red Sweater blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This update introduces an expansion of FastScripts’s own built-in
scripting additions, with three powerful new commands for
searching, replacing, and splitting text with regular expressions.</p>

<p>These can be used by any AppleScript on your Mac, whether you’re
running the script from FastScripts or not. These new commands are
also completely free of charge, so if you install and keep
FastScripts running in the background, your scripts will always
have access to these features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like anything scripting-related, there are many ways to use regular expressions for searching and replacing text in AppleScript. Having a few good commands (searching, replacing, and splitting) built into a utility like FastScripts though, with a good scripting dictionary for the syntax, is really convenient. I started beta testing this version of FastScripts a few weeks ago, and I’ve already made a few new scripts that use it, and edited a few old scripts to use FastScripts’s regex commands to replace the now-unnecessary <s>kludges</s> workarounds I was using before. Very cool, too, for sharing scripts with others, that these regex commands are available in the free version of FastScripts.</p>

<p>Matthew Panzarino, five years ago today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has finalized a deal to acquire <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Workflow</a> today — a
tool that lets you hook together apps and functions within apps in
strings of commands to automate tasks. We’ve been tracking this
one for a while but were able to confirm just now that the ink on
the deal is drying as we speak. [...]</p>

<p>The app was made by a small team that includes Ari Weinstein, a
former iPhone jailbreaker. I’ve been following his efforts since
the iPod Linux days and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/04/from-jailbreaks-to-app-store-awards-developers-grow-up-iphone/">covered his very useful DeskConnect
app</a> a few years back.</p>

<p>Workflow has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/11/workflow-lets-you-automate-the-stuff-you-do-all-the-time-on-your-iphone/">around for a couple of years</a> and we’ve
covered it and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/27/workflow-lets-you-put-shortcuts-to-frequent-actions-right-in-ioss-notification-center/">updates</a>. It shares some similarity with
the service IFTTT, in that it allows people to group together a
bunch of actions that can allow them to perform complicated tasks
with one tap. It had built up a sizeable number of users and
downloads over the past few years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was reminded of this anniversary <a href="https://twitter.com/johnvoorhees/status/1506272323585785856">via John Vorhees</a>, who linked to <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-future-of-workflow/">this prescient piece by Federico Viticci</a> written shortly after the acquisition. Viticci was far ahead of his time in seeing the potential for Workflow/Shortcuts.</p>

<p>I’m of two minds about the current state of Shortcuts. First, Shortcuts seems to be improving at a faster pace than ever before. The biggest improvement, of course, was bringing it to MacOS this year, with cross-platform compatibility with iOS wherever it makes sense, but also enabling Mac-only actions like executing AppleScript and shell scripts. Until Apple showed that they were committed to Shortcuts post-acquisition, there really was no system-wide automation story for iOS. It’s very encouraging that Shortcuts isn’t just alive at Apple, it’s alive and seemingly thriving.</p>

<p>But there’s a part of me that thinks Shortcuts as a first-party automation technology should be even further along than it is after five years inside Apple. My <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/on_the_origin_of_the_iphone">recent look back at the origins of the iPhone and iOS in particular</a>, and thinking about how much that relatively small team accomplished in just two years, has lowered my overall patience for platform advancements.</p>

<p>David Bradbury, chief security officer for Okta, in a brief post on the company’s blog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January 2022, Okta detected an unsuccessful attempt to
compromise the account of a customer support engineer working for
a third-party provider. As part of our regular procedures, we
alerted the provider to the situation, while simultaneously
terminating the user’s active Okta sessions and suspending the
individual’s account. Following those actions, we shared pertinent
information (including suspicious IP addresses) to supplement
their investigation, which was supported by a third-party
forensics firm.</p>

<p>Following the completion of the service provider’s investigation,
we received a report from the forensics firm this week. The report
highlighted that there was a five-day window of time between
January 16-21, 2022, where an attacker had access to a support
engineer’s laptop. This is consistent with the screenshots that we
became aware of yesterday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The screenshots they “became aware of yesterday” were shared on social media and, because Okta provides secure authentication to many companies, the breach <a href="https://www.techmeme.com/220322/p2#a220322p2">has been widely-publicized</a>. What Bradbury claims matches the evidence to date — that the attackers gained the privileges of a support engineer and no more. That’s something, but it doesn’t seem to be catastrophic. It would be a lot more reassuring, though, if the January incident had been disclosed <em>before</em> these screenshots were leaked to the public.</p>

<p>(This same hacking group, “Lapsus$”, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/lapsus-hackers-leak-37gb-of-microsofts-alleged-source-code/">claims to have stolen the source code for Cortana, Bing, and other projects from Microsoft</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2022/03/updated-okta-statement-on-lapsus/">New post from Bradbury</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After a thorough analysis of these claims, we have concluded that
a small percentage of customers — approximately 2.5% — have
potentially been impacted and whose data may have been viewed or
acted upon. We have identified those customers and are contacting
them directly. If you are an Okta customer and were impacted, we
have already reached out directly by email. We are sharing this
interim update, consistent with our values of customer success,
integrity, and transparency.</p>

<p>Yowza. Seems pretty likely to me this is how “Lapsus$” stole source code from Microsoft.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Mask mandates are political death at this point in state-wide races. An overwhelming majority of voters are opposed to continuing them. The new normal should be “Wear a mask to protect yourself if you want to.” Democrats need to repeal these mandates now so that they’re ancient history come November.</p>

<p>Double-down on vaccines. Vaccines are the solution to COVID-19, and Democrats can own them as a political issue. Take mask mandates off the table and just make it all about vaccinations, which really work and really help.</p>

It would be great if noise reduction were added to the list of Photo Styles we can adjust in iOS 16 this year. Keep the default aggressive but let us choose to dial it back.</p>

<p>Kyle Chayka, writing for The New Yorker:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In January, I traded my iPhone 7 for an iPhone 12 Pro, and I’ve
been dismayed by the camera’s performance. On the 7, the slight
roughness of the images I took seemed like a logical product of
the camera’s limited capabilities. I didn’t mind imperfections
like the “digital noise” that occurred when a subject was underlit
or too far away, and I liked that any editing of photos was up to
me. On the 12 Pro, by contrast, the digital manipulations are
aggressive and unsolicited. One expects a person’s face in front
of a sunlit window to appear darkened, for instance, since a
traditional camera lens, like the human eye, can only let light in
through a single aperture size in a given instant. But on my
iPhone 12 Pro even a backlit face appears strangely illuminated.
The editing might make for a theoretically improved photo — it’s
nice to see faces — yet the effect is creepy. When I press the
shutter button to take a picture, the image in the frame often
appears for an instant as it did to my naked eye. Then it
clarifies and brightens into something unrecognizable, and there’s
no way of reversing the process. David Fitt, a professional
photographer based in Paris, also went from an iPhone 7 to a 12
Pro, in 2020, and he still prefers the 7’s less powerful camera.
On the 12 Pro, “I shoot it and it looks overprocessed,” he said.
“They bring details back in the highlights and in the shadows that
often are more than what you see in real life. It looks
over-real.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chayka’s is an interesting take, for sure. He references Halide’s <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/03/22/de-with-iphone-13-pro-camera">aforelinked</a> deep analysis of the iPhone 13 Pro camera system (which is what reminded me to link to it) thus:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet, for some users, all of those optimizing features have had an
unwanted effect. Halide, a developer of camera apps, recently
published a careful examination of the 13 Pro that noted visual
glitches caused by the device’s intelligent photography, including
the erasure of bridge cables in a landscape shot. “Its complex,
interwoven set of ‘smart’ software components don’t fit together
quite right,” the report stated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That shot of the bridge was not a good result, but it wasn’t emblematic of the typical iPhone 13 camera experience in any way. I don’t think Chayka is being overly disingenuous, but for 99 percent of the photos taken by 99 percent of people (ballpark numbers, obviously) the iPhone 12 or 13 is a <em>way</em> better camera than an iPhone 7. Yet Chayka might leave some readers thinking they’re going to get better photos from a six-year-old iPhone, which simply isn’t true.</p>

<p>The problem is not that iPhone cameras have gotten too smart. It’s that they haven’t gotten smart enough. There most certainly are trade-offs between old-fashioned dumb photography and today’s state-of-the-art computational photography, but those trade-offs overwhelmingly favor computational photography. Chayka’s whole argument feels somewhat like arguments that shooting on film produced superior results compared to digital sensors circa 15 years ago.</p>

  <p>This year’s deep dive into Apple’s latest and greatest — the
iPhone 13 Pro — took extra time. I had to research a particular
set of quirks.</p>

<p>“Quirk”? This might be a bit of a startling thing to read, coming
from many reviews. Most smartphone reviews and technology websites
list the new iPhone 13 Pro’s camera system as being up there with
the best on the market right now.</p>

<p>I don’t disagree.</p>

<p>But I must admit I don’t take photos like most people. An average
iPhone user snaps a picture in Apple’s Camera app, and … I work on
my own camera app. I take photos in both Apple’s app and our own — and that lets me do something that Apple’s can’t: take native
RAW photos. These shots let me poke and prod at the unprocessed
photo that comes straight out of the hardware. Looking at the raw
data, I’ve concluded that while Apple has taken more than one leap
forward in hardware, they’re in a tricky position in software.</p>

<p>Lauren Hough:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My book won’t win a prize because my friend Sandra Newman wrote a
book. The premise of her book is “what if all the men
disappeared.” When she announced the book on twitter, YA twitter
saw it. This is the single most terrifying thing that can happen
to a writer on twitter. YA twitter, presumably fans of young adult
fiction, are somehow unfamiliar with the concept of fiction. YA
twitter doesn’t do nuance. They don’t understand metaphor or
thought experiment. They expect fictional characters to be good
and moral and just, whether antagonist or protagonist. They expect
characters and plot to be free of conflict. They require fiction
to portray a world without racism, bigotry, and bullies. And when
YA twitter gets wind of a book that doesn’t meet their demands,
they respond with a beatdown so unrelenting and vicious it would
shock William Golding. They call it “call-out culture” because
bullying is wrong, unless your target is someone you don’t like,
for social justice reasons, of course.</p>

<p>Publishing hasn’t yet figured out how to respond to YA twitter.
Authors who’ve been targeted have left social media entirely.
Reviewers shy away. Publishers have pulled books. Authors have
changed lines, characters, and scenes in their books hoping to
avoid becoming a target, or to appease YA twitter once they have.
And once they have become targets, those writers often find
themselves alone — their friends and colleagues silent for fear
of becoming targets themselves. The entirety of the publishing
world is terrified of a few hundred self-described book lovers on
social media who are shockingly bad at reading books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Very strange that Hough’s award nomination would be revoked for this, because after The New York Times editorial board’s much-discussed opinion piece last week, backed by polling, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/18/opinion/cancel-culture-free-speech-poll.html">arguing that America has a problem with free speech as a social ideal</a>, I learned on Twitter that this just isn’t so and <a href="https://twitter.com/adamdavidson/status/1504798568808390670">that “cancel culture” does not exist</a>.</p>

<p>(Snark aside, may I suggest that even if you disagree with the Times editorial board’s opinion, their polling results are eye-opening regarding whether Americans — on both the right and left — <em>believe</em> that we have a growing problem with tolerance for opinions we disagree with. Much of the knee-jerk reaction to the Times editorial board’s opinion seems like proof in and of itself that they were right.)</p>

<p>Speaking of The Times, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/21/books/lauren-hough-lambda-literary.html">here’s their story today by reporter Marc Tracy</a> on Lambda Literary’s revocation of Hough’s award nomination:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hough said Monday that she could not recall whether she had
deleted any tweets, and denied that any of her tweets had
been transphobic. Lambda did not provide examples of the
posts they were most critical of. The Times has not reviewed
any deleted tweets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s really something. <a href="https://twitter.com/heerjeet/status/1506081471483756545">Jeet Heer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m a bit baffled by this. How do we adjudicate a controversy
about something said when its deleted, neither party wants to
quote it, and the reporter hasn’t seen it?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As highlighted by developer <a href="https://twitter.com/KhaosT/status/1505696683677532163">“Khaos Tian” on Twitter</a>, the
Studio Display only uses 2GB of its 64GB of internal NAND storage.
Some free space is likely needed for firmware updates, but the
62GB of unused space is seemingly otherwise useless at the current
time. Apple has not confirmed the quantity of the Studio Display’s
internal storage in its technical specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those things that both makes perfect sense (the Studio Display contains an embedded A13 SoC and the A13’s lowest storage tier is 64 GB) and seems kind of crazy (the Studio Display has 64 GB of storage that is mostly unused and isn’t accessible to users). Effectively there’s a base model 9th-generation iPad in there.</p>

<p>Rasmus Larsen, writing for FlatpanelsHD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple TV app arrived on Google TV in <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1613706116">early 2021</a> and on Android TV in the <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1622606942">summer of 2021</a>, complete with Apple TV+ access, channels, and the ability to rent and purchase iTunes movies directly on the device.</p>

<p>The latest app update has removed the option to rent and purchase movies on Android TV and Google TV devices. The two buttons have been replaced by a new “How to Watch” button which states: “You can buy, rent or subscribe in the Apple TV app on iPhone, iPad, and other streaming devices.” [...]</p>

<p>It is unclear why Apple has downgraded its app on Android TV and Google TV but it could be related to commission rates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can confirm via, as they say, sources familiar with the matter, that this is entirely about Apple and Google not being able to reach mutually agreeable terms on in-app payment commissions. Until this update, Apple had been running on an exemption not to use Google’s IAP. The exemption expired, so Apple TV on Android TV is now “reader only”. Apple TV on Amazon’s Fire platform has long been “reader only” as well for the same reason: Apple would rather not sell or rent any content at all on these platforms than do so while paying Google/Amazon the commissions they demand.</p>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/21/apple-tv-app-on-android-blocks-sales/">Ben Lovejoy, commenting on FlatpanelsHD’s report at 9to5Mac</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If so, it would be ironic at a time when Apple is defending its own App Store commissions against developer complaints and antitrust investigations around the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t think Apple going read-only on these platforms is ironic at all. Apple is doing on these platforms what all developers can choose to do on Apple’s platforms: if they don’t like the commission rates, don’t sell anything.</p>

<p>What’s hypocritical is Apple offering a “How to Watch” button, with a simple clear explanation of how you <em>can</em> buy or rent new content to watch on Android TV by making the purchase on a different device. That’s not allowed on Apple’s own platforms — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement">Apple has a rule against explaining the rules</a>.</p>

The Trump administration’s support, when MBS was at his most vulnerable, saved him. “If MBS ultimately becomes king,” Murphy said, “he owes no one bigger than Jared Kushner,” Trump’s personal envoy to the crown prince.

<p>Three quick notes on the Studio Display:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>An hour or so ago I posted an update to my Studio Display review worth flagging here in a post of its own. After the paragraph where I wrote that I wasn’t going to hold my breath for a software update that actually makes the image quality from the Studio Display camera good, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_apple_studio_display#update-1">the update</a> reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe I <em>should</em> hold my breath. Multiple little birdies familiar
with the Studio Display, each birdie independent of the others,
tell me that the image quality problems really are a software
problem, not hardware — a bug introduced at the last minute — and a future software update might not merely somewhat improve
image quality, but raise it to a level commensurate with the iPad
models equipped with the same camera (the new Air and last year’s
Pros), modulo the differences between the M1 and A13 ISPs. That
would be excellent news, if true. But someone at Apple is having a
very bad day today, if true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s hoping.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of software updates for the Studio Display, you can check the “display firmware version” in System Information, under “Graphics/Displays”. There, you can see that not only does the Studio Display run iOS, it literally runs iOS 15.4: “Version 15.4 (Build 19E241)”. That’s iOS 15.4 right down to the build number — 19E241 is the same build number as iOS 15.4 and iPadOS 15.4.</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/studio-display-firmware.png" class="noborder">
<img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/studio-display-firmware.png" alt="Screenshot from System Information showing that the display firmware version number of the Studio Display is “Version 15.4 (Build 19E241”." width="500"></a></p>

<p>I shouldn’t be surprised by this but I am. But this means that if the camera image quality issues can be remedied/improved via a software update, we’re not waiting for a bug fix release for MacOS 12, but for iOS 15. Or both? I’m curious to see how software updates for the Studio Display work.</p></li>
<li><p>I should have mentioned this in the review itself but forgot to: “Apple Studio Display” is a <em>great</em> name.</p></li>

<h6 class="dateline">Thursday, 17 March 2022</h6>

<p>In the latter half of the 2010s, the Mac was having a bad time.</p>

<p>The small cylindrical Mac Pro introduced in 2013 was a dead end. The butterfly-switch keyboards used throughout the entire MacBook lineup were <a href="https://www.caseyjohnston.net/apple-keyboards/">prone</a> to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/graphics/apple-still-hasnt-fixed-its-macbook-keyboard-problem/">failure</a> (and, to most people’s tastes, didn’t have a good feel even when they were functioning perfectly). Apple’s most popular Mac, the MacBook Air, hadn’t been updated in years and lacked a retina display, making it look even more dated than it actually was (and it was quite dated). Apple stopped making standalone displays, assuming third-party display makers would fill the gap, and the gap was never filled with anything nearly approaching Apple’s own standards. Dependent on Intel, MacBooks were surpassed by iPads and even iPhones in chip performance — not just performance-per-watt but straight up speed. Apple’s iOS devices ran fast and cool and quiet; MacBooks, more and more, were running slow and hot and loud.</p>

<p>Not good.</p>

<p>But item by item, Apple started fixing what was wrong. The iMac Pro and then an all-new Mac Pro addressed everything wrong with the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple threw in the towel on revisions to the butterfly keyboards and shipped MacBooks with keyboards that are more than merely reliable but are downright great. They shipped a retina MacBook Air and people loved it. They moved the whole platform from Intel’s flailing x86 architecture to Apple silicon and stunned the industry with the results. They even recommitted to the Mac Mini, perhaps the most unassuming computer the company has ever made, but which plays an essential role in many workflows, both professional and consumer.</p>

<p>The final wrong Apple needed to make right was a standalone display. Yes, they started their return to the display market in 2019 with the $5000 (and up) Pro Display XDR, but that’s like saying a vehicle company that had only been making trucks returned to the car market with a $150,000 race car. What Mac users wanted was seemingly obvious. A bright high-quality display at least 27 inches in size with at least 5K resolution, and Apple-caliber color management. Good speakers and microphones. An array of ports and integration to fill the much-needed role of a big-screen docking station for MacBook users. And a good built-in camera.</p>

<p>The new Apple Studio Display aims to be just that. Alas, it falls woefully short in one of those regards.</p>

<h2 id="screen">Screen</h2>

<p>The screen itself is great. Plenty bright, wonderful color, very sharp, perfectly consistent from corner to corner, and at 27 inches is a nice big size. My review unit is the $1600 base model with the standard glossy finish and tilt-only base. On my desk, it’s the perfect height; if I had the model with the adjustable-height base, I’d probably set it at this exact height anyway. My office gets enough direct sunlight — more on this below, don’t you worry — that I’m considering the model with nano-texture glass for my own purchase, but even on sunny days the standard glossy finish’s anti-reflective coating is as effective at reducing glare and reflection as one could hope.</p>

<p>Sitting in front of it, there’s nothing to see except the screen itself and a half-inch thick black surrounding bezel. I love the way it looks.</p>

<h2 id="integration">Integration and Hardware Design</h2>

<p>Integration-wise, it’s very good. It has three USB-C ports with up to 10 Gb/s speed, and one Thunderbolt 3 port. That Thunderbolt port is the one you connect your Mac to, and if that Mac is a MacBook, it charges at up to 96 watts, which, I believe, is all you could ask for. Apple includes a 1-meter Thunderbolt cable with the Studio Display and it’s perfect — black, and a very nice braided fabric cable. I’ve spent most of the last week testing the Studio Display not with the Mac Studio, but with an Apple silicon MacBook Pro, which is how I intend to use it personally, and how most Mac users will too. Apple stopped breaking down Mac sales by desktop/laptop years ago, for competitive purposes, but it’s no secret the overwhelming majority of Macs sold today are MacBooks of some sort. I believe that number was at least 80 percent in 2021, and will only go higher this year, despite Apple’s desktop lineup being better than ever.</p>

<p>What I want from a desktop display for use with my MacBook is not to think about it. I want just one cable to plug in and out of my MacBook, and for everything to just work. When I plug the MacBook in, I want the display to just turn on and everything appear on screen at the size and position I expect. I want the MacBook to charge at a high speed through that one cable. When I want to take the MacBook away from the desk, I just want to unplug that one cable. That’s how the Studio Display works — for the most part. I personally do not like spanning across multiple displays, especially if they’re not the same size, so I keep my MacBook lid closed when connected to the Studio Display. A few times over the last week, upon connecting my MacBook Pro, the Studio Display turned on and my desktop picture was only 75 percent the size of the display, and the MacOS Dock was similarly confused about the size and resolution of the Studio Display. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/mis-sized-desktop.png">Here’s a screenshot</a> from a few days ago when this happened. The handful of times I ran into this, I could fix it simply by opening the MacBook’s lid (which triggers a rejiggering to turn on both displays) and then closing it again a few seconds later (which triggers another rejiggering to put everything back on the Studio Display as the sole active display). This seems like a glitch with MacOS 12, not the Studio Display in particular. I haven’t used a standalone display with my MacBooks in a few years, so I can’t say how common this is with other displays. But I expect perfection in this regard.</p>

<p>One thing that I greatly appreciate but is easy to take for granted is that the Studio Display does not require a power brick. It uses just a power cable with a simple prong at the end — which, like the aforementioned Thunderbolt cable, is black and made from the same nice braided fabric. Last year’s 24-inch M1 iMacs are strikingly thin in profile, but the cost of that remarkable thinness is that they require an external power brick that is pretty much the same size and weight as an Apple TV 4K. By my measurements, the 24-inch iMac display is about 11mm thick. The Studio Display is almost double that thickness: 19mm (~0.75 inches). That’s fine. The Studio Display is thin enough, and the extra thickness is well worth it for everything it provides, particularly the fact that it can charge a connected MacBook at 96 watts without using an external power brick.</p>

<p>There is no power button. There are no buttons on the Studio Display at all, in fact. It is subtle, but when on, the Studio Display is constantly blowing a small amount of air out the top and bottom. The aluminum frame never gets the least bit warm, and the cooling system makes no sound whatsoever. The tilting hinge works great — sturdy enough that it never budges accidentally while plugging something into a USB port, and loose enough that it’s easily adjustable when desired. I suppose I’d like a space gray (or dare I dream, even black) option in addition to silver, but otherwise I wouldn’t change a thing about how it looks. Form-factor- and integration-wise, the Studio Display approaches perfection.</p>

<h2 id="audio">Audio</h2>

<p>The built-in speakers sound great, and the built-in microphone array makes <em>you</em> sound good. Like many of Apple’s products with built-in speakers in recent years, they sound bigger, deeper, and clearer than possible given their size and inconspicuousness. There’s no need to wear headphones or use an external microphone during video chats (other than for privacy, obviously). In my testing, I sound better speaking into the Studio Display’s microphone array than I do using the microphones in my AirPod Pros.</p>

<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>

<p>Which brings us to the camera, which I find to be crushingly disappointing. Image quality is astonishingly poor, and Center Stage is glitchy.</p>

<p>Apple says the Studio Display uses the same 12 megapixel ultra-wide camera as in recent iPads — including <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">the new iPad Air</a>. Here are two images of me at my desk, on a sunny afternoon. This one is from the new iPad Air’s front-facing camera:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-ipad-air.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-ipad-air.jpeg" alt="Me at my desk, on a sunny afternoon, shot using the 2022 iPad Air front-facing camera." width="500"></a></p>

<p>This one is from the Studio Display:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-studio-display.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-studio-display.jpeg" alt="Me at my desk, on the same sunny afternoon, shot using the Studio Display camera." width="500"></a></p>

<p>These two photos were taken seconds apart, in identical lighting. Yes that direct sunlight is harsh, but that’s where I sit, and the new iPad Air handles it well. The image from the Studio Display is terrible. And I’m not cherry-picking one bad image. I took dozens of photos, and the above is representative of the image quality you get from the Studio Display camera. These images, and the ones below, are also representative of the image quality during video calls.</p>

<p>One of these is from a $600 iPad. The other from a $1600 display. Both are using the same camera hardware. It doesn’t make sense that they look so different, and makes less sense that the one that looks like ass is from the $1600 product. Yes, the iPad Air has the M1’s image signal processor, and the Studio Display uses its built-in A13 chip’s ISP, and the M1 is better than the A13. But not <em>that</em> much better.</p>

<p>Even without harsh sunlight, all images from the Studio Display camera, in all lighting conditions, are grainy, lacking in contrast, and make skin tones look cadaveric. Here’s another comparison, taken at night.</p>

<p>iPhone SE (3rd generation), front-facing camera:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-iphone-se.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-iphone-se.jpeg" alt="Me at my desk at night, shot using the iPhone SE (3rd generation) front-facing camera." width="500"></a></p>

<p>Studio Display:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-studio-display.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/camera-night-studio-display.jpeg" alt="Me at my desk at night, shot using the Studio Display camera." width="500"></a></p>

<p>Again, these two photos were taken seconds apart, under identical lighting.</p>

<p>Is the Studio Display camera unusable? No. I suppose it’s at least as good as the image quality from the camera on Apple silicon MacBooks. But that’s a low bar. MacBooks have thin lids, leaving very little room for cameras. The Studio Display is 0.75 inches thick. How can the image quality from the camera on a $1600 display be so much worse — laughably worse — than the image quality from a $600 iPad Air that uses the exact same camera hardware? Let alone comparing it to the front-facing camera on the $430 iPhone SE, which makes the Studio Display camera look like a toy. And we waited <em>years</em> for Apple to ship this display.</p>

<p>Again, it’s <em>usable</em>. All sorts of people use way worse cameras for videoconferencing every day. But this image quality is embarrassing from a company <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/01/25/om-iphone-camera">that considers itself <em>the</em> leading camera company in the world</a>. I’m not suggesting the Studio Display camera should match the quality of, say, the new iPhone SE’s <em>rear</em>-facing camera (but then again, why not?). I’m saying I expected the Studio Display camera to match the quality of, at least, the iPhone SE’s <em>front</em>-facing camera. I expected to be impressed by the Studio Display camera. Instead, I’m baffled. I don’t understand how this shipped.</p>

<p>It gets even worse. The Center Stage feature on the Studio Display should be called Off-Center Stage. Move around a bit or turn your head to the side and you get framed off to the side, even though you’re sitting directly in front of the center of the display. It takes up to 5 seconds for Center Stage to catch up and re-center you in the frame, which it does slowly and sheepishly, as though it’s embarrassed. On iPads with Center Stage, it’s like having a cameraperson following you around, reframing the image as you move. On the Studio Display, it’s as though that cameraperson is distracted, paying attention to something else, and then they realize, oops, you — the subject they’re supposed to be following — are framed poorly, and they sheepishly pan the camera to reframe you. Here’s an example screenshot from a FaceTime call:</p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/off-center-stage.jpeg" class="noborder">
  <img src="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/off-center-stage.jpeg" alt="Example of poor framing from Center Stage during a FaceTime call." width="500"></a></p>

<p>My face is dead center in front of the Studio Display here, and it took 4–5 seconds for Center Stage to reframe. Note too the deplorable image quality, in what should be nearly ideal lighting conditions.</p>

<p>I don’t really understand why Apple chose to support Center Stage with the Studio Display, and thus use this ultra-wide angle camera, in the first place. Center Stage feels clever and useful on iPads, which are often handheld and often positioned in all sorts of different angles and dynamic positions. But how is that a good choice for the camera on a big desktop display that isn’t intended to move around, and which you tend to sit in front of in a fixed position? Apple’s primary concern for the Studio Display camera should have been generating the best possible image quality for a single person at arm’s length in front of the screen, not Center Stage.</p>

<p>I shared my concerns and some of the above examples with Apple during my testing. Yesterday I was told by an Apple spokesperson that they’ve identified some issues where the Studio Display is not delivering the image quality they expected, and they will be making improvements in future software updates. (I feel like I could have written this paragraph before I even got that call.)</p>

<p>The Off-Center Stage thing is obviously a bug, and I expect that to be fixed. The overall image quality, I’ll bet, can and will be improved to <em>some</em> degree via software updates,<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-17"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-17">1</a></sup> but I’ll be surprised — happily surprised, but surprised — if a software update can turn this camera into something Apple should be proud of. Maybe, though, given that it’s the same camera hardware as the front-facing camera on the new iPad Air and last year’s iPad Pros. But I’m not holding my breath.</p>

<p>[<strong><span id="update-1">Update, seven hours after publication</span>:</strong> Maybe I <em>should</em> hold my breath. Multiple little birdies familiar with the Studio Display, each birdie independent of the others, tell me that the image quality problems really are a software problem, not hardware — a bug introduced at the last minute — and a future software update might not merely somewhat improve image quality, but raise it to a level commensurate with the iPad models equipped with the same camera (the new Air and last year’s Pros), modulo the differences between the M1 and A13 ISPs. That would be excellent news, if true. But someone at Apple is having a very bad day today, if true.]</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Studio Display doesn’t support ProMotion, but I honestly don’t know if ProMotion is technically feasible over Thunderbolt. Apple started shipping iPads with ProMotion support in 2017, and the 2019 Pro Display XDR — which costs $5000 — doesn’t support it either. What I really wish the Studio Display supported is Face ID. Apple’s biometric authentication story for Macs seems focused solely on Touch ID, so I’m not surprised that it doesn’t. But Touch ID on a desktop requires Apple’s Magic Keyboard, and alas for me, the Apple keyboard <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/albums/72157604797968156/">I prefer</a>, and on which I’m writing these words, came out a few years before Touch ID was a thing.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that I find the camera crushingly disappointing,<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-17"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-17">2</a></sup> I’m almost certainly buying a Studio Display for myself. The Pro Display XDR doesn’t have a camera at all, and if the Studio Display didn’t have one either, I’d find that curious (and I’d have complained about it here), but I’d still buy it. And the Studio Display camera is better than having no built-in camera at all — it’s just disappointing. </p>

<p>I spent most of the space in this review discussing and illustrating my disappointment in the camera, but I don’t know how to say more to express my joy with, for example, the audio quality of the speakers and the visual quality of the screen. I’ve been waiting years for Apple to release a good desktop display for under $2000, and in every single regard <em>other</em> than the camera, the Studio Display meets or exceeds my expectations.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The Apple Studio Display’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_apple_studio_display">★</a></p>

<li id="fn1-2022-03-17">
<p>Here’s a weird thing. I started testing the Studio Display last Friday, using an M1 MacBook Pro running MacOS 12.2. The Studio Display officially requires MacOS 12.3, which didn’t ship until Monday this week. While running MacOS 12.2 over the weekend, there was no support for Center Stage, but, I swear, image quality from the camera was slightly better than what I’ve seen since testing it with Macs running MacOS 12.3. There was more contrast, for sure — images didn’t look quite so dreadfully flat and dull. I didn’t capture careful example photos while running 12.2, though, because I expected image quality to get better, if anything, after upgrading to the officially supported 12.3 release. The image quality difference I’m talking about here was subtle, not dramatic, so while I do think there’s room for the image quality to improve with future software updates, it doesn’t give me any hope that it will ever be good.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2022-03-17" class="footnoteBackLink" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Big football news from ESPN today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ESPN has signed acclaimed play-by-play commentator Joe Buck and
leading football analyst Troy Aikman to multi-year deals, as the
NFL’s longest current booth pairing and Pro Football Hall of Fame
members will become the new voices of Monday Night Football. The
iconic duo’s 2022 Monday Night Football debut will mark their 21st
NFL season in the booth together, matching the legendary Pat
Summerall and John Madden’s all-time record as on-air NFL
partners. In their two decades together, Buck and Aikman have
called six Super Bowls, surpassing all other pairings/booths
except for Summerall and Madden. [...]</p>

<p>Troy Aikman said, “The opportunity to be a voice on Monday Night
Football, adding to its legacy and being a part of the future of
the NFL on ESPN, has me motivated and reflective. As a kid in
California, the voices of Frank Gifford, Howard Cosell, and my
mom’s personal favorite, Don Meredith, echoed throughout our
living room each week. Joe and I are humbled to be part of that
same tradition that has existed for more than 50 years across
generations of football fans.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shine has been off Monday Night Football ever since John Madden and Al Michaels left for NBC in 2006. Aikman and Buck put the shine back on. (And Don Meredith was everyone’s favorite; Cosell was the guy everyone in America loved to hate.) ESPN and ABC have the Super Bowl in 2027 and 2031, too. And now it looks like Fox is left holding a bag of “<em>Who?</em>” for their top booth team.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 16 March 2022</h6>

<p>The iPad family has sort of settled in to a consistent lineup for a few years, with five models. Three of them are distinctive:</p>

<ul>
<li>iPad, no adjective: the low cost one ($330 starting price)</li>
<li>iPad Mini: the small one ($500)</li>
<li>iPad Pro 13-inch: the big one, with the best specs ($1100)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want the cheapest, smallest, or biggest iPad, your decision is easy. But in the middle — where most people’s needs, desires, and budgets reside — choosing between the 11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air is not so easy. For one thing, they’re almost exactly the same size. What I call the “13-inch” iPad Pro above is officially 12.9 inches. I have never understood why Apple doesn’t want to call that “13 inches”. Go look at a ruler: a tenth of an inch (~2.5mm) is negligible.</p>

<p>But I <em>do</em> get why Apple wants to call the iPad Air’s size 10.9 inches instead of rounding that up to an even 11: side-by-side with the iPad Pro, you can see that the iPad Air has a slightly thicker bezel surrounding its thus slightly smaller display. But while their display sizes are slightly different, their case dimensions are effectively identical. The only difference is that the Air is 0.2mm thicker — close enough that they both fit the same Magic Keyboard, just different enough that Apple makes separate Smart Folio covers for each. But practically speaking, they’re the same size.</p>

<p>As usual, Apple’s online “Compare” page is exemplary for examining their differences. <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad/compare/?modelList=ipad-air-5th-gen,ipad-pro-11-3rd-gen,ipad-air-4th-gen">Here’s a link to the Compare page listing three iPads</a>: the new 5th-generation iPad Air (which I’ve been testing since last week), the 3rd generation 11-inch iPad Pro (which <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/05/the_2021_m1_ipad_pros">debuted in May last year</a>), and the now-discontinued 4th-generation iPad Air (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_2020_ipad_air">which debuted in October 2020</a>). I’ve also saved a <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/ipad-air5-pro3-air4-compare.pdf">PDF of this three-way comparison</a> for posterity.</p>

<p>Most of the differences between the new iPad Air and last year’s iPad Pro — and the differences between the new iPad Air and the 2020 iPad Air — are easily discerned from that page. Highlights, to my thinking: the iPad Pro has Face ID, and the new iPad Air still has Touch ID on the power button; only the iPad Pro display supports ProMotion;<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-16"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-16">1</a></sup> both support 5G cellular networking but only the iPad Pro supports mmWave (a.k.a. ultra wideband). The iPad Pro has four speakers, but the iPad Air still only two. In landscape this means the Air only has speakers on one side of the display; in portrait, only on the bottom.</p>

<p>On the flip side, the iPad Air comes in fun colors — my review unit is blue and everyone here at DF HQ agrees it’s comely. The iPad Pro only comes in silver or space gray.</p>

<p>But what isn’t quite as discernible are the differences in price. The iPad Air base model starts at $600 and the iPad Pro at $800, but that’s not a gigabyte-to-gigabyte comparison. Here’s the full pricing table:</p>

<p><small>* These models come with 16 GB of memory; the others all come with 8 GB.</small></p>

<p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/10/the_2020_ipad_air">Once again</a>, the iPad Air and iPad Pro only share a single storage tier: 256 GB, and at 256 GB, the price difference is just $150. (The extra $50 charge for cellular networking on iPad Pro is the price you pay for mmWave support. Those Qualcomm modems aren’t free and Apple isn’t eating the cost.)</p>

<p>If you really need or want 1–2 TB of storage and/or double the RAM, your choice is made for you, but you’ll pay at least double the price of the 256 GB iPad Air. If not — and the vast majority of iPad users, even serious ones, should do just fine with 256 GB of storage and the default 8 GB of RAM — the question is whether the iPad Pro is worth $150 extra.</p>

<p>For <em>me</em>, Face ID alone is worth $150. I use my iPad in a Magic Keyboard frequently, perhaps even a majority of the time. It’s my kitchen computer. And I find using Touch ID on the power button somewhat awkward when the iPad Air is in the Magic Keyboard. But the Magic Keyboard is a $300 peripheral. It’s not a niche product but it’s certainly not for everyone. iPads are fundamentally handheld tablets, and handheld, the iPad Air’s Touch ID instead of Face ID is much less of a difference. I still decidedly prefer Face ID, though. Touch ID on the iPad Air makes it feel easy to unlock. Face ID on the iPad Pro makes it seems like it wasn’t even locked in the first place.</p>

<p>Overall, when you look at the specs as they stand today, it seems like there should be just one 11-inch iPad Air or Pro. But that’s just the result of the tick-tock pattern of Apple’s iPad refresh cycle. None of the models in the iPad family are on annual refresh cycles like iPhones are. Because all new iPhones — SE models excepted — debut alongside each other every September, the overall iPhone product matrix makes sense continuously. With most iPad models getting updated roughly every 18 months, but with the iPads Pro and iPad Air on opposite sides of the calendar, the comparisons are never quite aligned. Right now, with the brand-new iPad Air upgraded to the same M1 chip that’s in the iPad Pro, it looks like there’s little reason for the 11-inch iPad Pro to exist. Apple could add a few higher-capacity storage options for the iPad Air, add Face ID, and make it the one and only “11-inch” mid-to-high-end iPad.</p>

<p>But wait until later this year, probably October, and if the iPads Pro get refreshed — as one would expect not just from the rumor mill, but by looking at Apple’s historic pattern — all of a sudden the differences between the iPad Air and iPad Pro should be much more profound. And then a year later in the fall of 2023, there will likely come a 6th-generation iPad Air that will significantly close the gap again. That’s how it goes. Or at least that’s how it’s been going for the last few cycles.</p>

<p>Right now, though, the new iPad Air is a lovely device. And if your iPad usage is such that you really don’t need more than 64 GB of storage, at $600 (or $750 with cellular<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-16"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-16">2</a></sup>), it’s a veritable bargain.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe remains unchanged from all recent iPad models: the front-facing camera placement is awkward when the iPad is oriented in landscape, but landscape is how the iPad is oriented when it’s in a Magic Keyboard <em>or</em> propped up using a folded Smart Folio cover — and those are the natural ways to use an iPad for a video chat at a desk or on a counter. It’s a great camera (and the M1 has an excellent image signal processor), but horizontally, you wind up with a high-quality image of yourself from a bad angle. The camera is too low and off to the side. If you look at the camera you’re not looking at the screen, and if you look at the screen the camera makes it look like you’re <em>not</em> looking at the screen. I don’t know what the solution to this problem is, but Apple hasn’t found it yet.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The 2022 iPad Air’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_ipad_air">★</a></p>

<h1><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_iphone_se" title="Permanent link to ‘The 2022 iPhone SE’">The 2022 iPhone&nbsp;SE</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Tuesday, 15 March 2022</h6>

<p>The biggest institutional difference between Apple and Microsoft is, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2471632/steve-jobs-on-microsoft---they-just-have-no-taste--.html">famously</a>, taste. Another, though, is their contrasting approaches to backward compatibility. Microsoft <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031015-00/?p=42163">bends over backward to maintain it</a> and <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061106-01/?p=29123">their customers thank them for it</a>. Apple eschews it when they see a better way forward, and their users gripe about it and then get over it.<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-15"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-15">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But one reason for this institutional difference isn’t merely company culture; it’s size. Microsoft, historically, was big; Apple, relatively speaking, small. Backward compatibility is a big company thing — or, better put, a big customer base thing. With enough total customers and an addressable market of “almost everyone”, there inevitably is going to be a sizable segment demanding backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Apple today, of course, is big. And while the Mac and iPad and Apple Watch are all big and growing, Apple sits atop <a href="https://americanbusinesshistory.org/most-valuable-companies-the-last-25-years/">the world’s market cap list</a> today because of the iPhone, and the iPhone customer base is simply enormous. I, for one, admit that my mind isn’t capable of fully grasping just how many people in the world use iPhones, nor how many new iPhones Apple sells each month, each week, each day, each hour. Apple doesn’t serve this enormous market by making dozens and dozens of different models — or even a single dozen. Go to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone page</a> and they list just <em>five</em> fundamental models in the header navigation. Five!</p>

<ul>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max</li>
<li>iPhone 13 and 13 Mini</li>
<li>iPhone 12 and 12 Mini</li>
<li>iPhone 11</li>
</ul>

<p>And, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2022/03/iphone-march-2022-header.png">right in the middle of that list</a>, the iPhone SE. The middle of the list is where it belongs — the newest in some ways, the oldest in others.</p>

<p>Every other model in the iPhone lineup follows the design paradigm of the iPhone X, which was introduced in September 2017, which was a lifetime ago in iPhone years. Edge-to-edge round-cornered OLED displays, Face ID, and a gestural interface for navigating the entire system.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULu8quXtOak">One of these things is not like the others</a>, and that’s the iPhone SE, with its forehead and chin above and below its square-cornered LCD display, and a Home button interface with Touch ID. Even putting Face ID vs. Touch ID aside — a big difference to put aside — the Home button embodies a fundamentally different interaction model for the iPhone. It was <em>weird</em> switching to the iPhone X after a decade using Home-button iPhones. It is even weirder now, going back to it, as I have since Friday, testing the new third generation iPhone SE. I even forgot how to take screenshots.<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-15"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-15">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Even before I got accustomed to the iPhone X’s fundamental changes to the interaction model, I was convinced Apple had designed something better, not merely something different. Four years later, I suspect just about everyone reading this would agree. The Home button interaction is almost spectacularly simple, which was exactly the right design in the early years of the iPhone, when it sounded crazy that you could do everything from email to web browsing to calendaring to you-name-it, all on your <em>phone</em>, the little thing that goes in your pants pocket. So many features — infinite features, really — but no matter what you did, how deep into any app you got, you were one hardware button click away from going home, to a simple grid of app icons. The iPhone supported multitasking a few years into the Home button era, but it was an interaction model that felt naturally suited to doing one thing at a time. Do one thing, go back home, then do another thing or put the phone down. The iPhone X model is fluid and feels naturally suited to a mental model of flowing between multiple apps. It was a bold move to make a change so fundamental to a product so insanely popular, but clearly the right one. I won’t rehash more of this, as I’ll only repeat myself from <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/04/the_2020_iphone_se">my review of the 2020 iPhone SE</a>.</p>

<p>But here’s the thing: some people don’t like bold moves, even if they’re good. For some people — many of them, but make no mistake definitely not all, older — <em>familiarity</em> trumps all. The technotariat class may think it offensive or spiteful or just plain goofy that Apple’s entry model iPhone looks and feels half a decade old. It even still has just one frigging camera on the back, with a lens so unassuming it barely juts out. But that’s what many people want: a new iPhone that looks and works like the one they already know and understand and feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>What would be nice, though, they’d all agree, is if it were faster and had longer battery life and took better photos, even if only moderately so. Not the best photos from any phone on the market — just better than the ones on whatever phone they’ve been using. That’s the iPhone SE. It literally has the fastest chip of any phone from any company at any price, the A15. But that’s not what matters to potential iPhone SE buyers. That’s almost a negative point for them — “the fastest phone chip in the world” sounds to them like something they don’t need. What matters is that the A15 is the most efficient phone chip in the world, too. It should last noticeably longer — hours longer — in typical use compared to the 2020 iPhone SE, and <em>much</em> longer than the several-years-old phones with depleted batteries most iPhone SE buyers are likely replacing. After last week’s announcement, I saw many nerds on Twitter — people who clearly had no interest themselves in buying the iPhone SE — griping that it’s downright wrong for Apple to put a “faster” chip in the same old form factor without greatly increasing the capacity of the battery. Too many nerds have internalized the way it used to be, that when chips got faster they necessarily consumed more power. Apple silicon has fundamentally changed that equation. The A15 in the new third-gen iPhone SE is both faster <em>and</em> more power efficient than the A13 in the second-gen iPhone SE. But more importantly, the sort of people who bought the second-gen iPhone SE aren’t in the market to replace them yet, and won’t be for a few years. Folks buying this new iPhone will be coming from phones like the iPhone 7 and 8, if not older.</p>

<p>The camera hardware is unchanged from the 2020 SE, but the image quality of photos is superior because so much of image quality from phone cameras comes from the image signal processing on the chips, and the A15’s ISP produces noticeably superior results.</p>

<p>I do hear a tiny little trombone playing a sad <em>wah-wah</em>, and that tune is playing because the price for the new iPhone SE has gone up by $30 at each storage tier: $430/$480/$580 for 64/128/256 GB of storage. That seems to be standard for Apple’s pricing for each device that goes from LTE to 5G cellular networking, with the exception of the iPhone Pro models — the most expensive iPhones. There’s a reason why Apple fought Qualcomm tooth-and-nail in court <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/04/why_apple_settled_with_qualcomm">before throwing in the towel and settling in 2019</a>, and there’s a reason Apple is working its ass off to <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/618603/apples-first-5g-modem-may-compete-with-qualcomms-snapdragon-x70.html">make its own 5G modems</a>. Qualcomm charges a premium for their 5G modems because they’re the best. Apple, of all companies, understands that.</p>

<p>I don’t think this $30 price increase will hurt sales, even with the SE — the iPhone that clearly is targeted at the most price-sensitive potential customers. For one thing, inflation is everywhere at the moment. An extra $30 for an iPhone is nothing compared to what’s going on in the car market. But more importantly, I think many, if not most, of the people who will buy an iPhone SE in the next few years aren’t going to pay for it up front. Go to a carrier’s product page for the new SE, e.g. <a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-se-3rd-gen-2022-64gb-midnight.html?q=iphone%20se">AT&amp;T’s</a> or <a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-se-2022/?sku=sku5230177">Verizon’s</a>, and they don’t tell you the up-front price other than in tiny gray small print. They tell you it costs $12/month. They do this with all phones they sell, not just the iPhone SE, but that’s how many people buy phones today. They’re advertising them on installment plans because it works.</p>

<p>The most interesting question to me is not whether Apple should have switched this generation of iPhone SE to the iPhone X interaction model, but whether they’ll even change it with the <em>next</em> SE model two or three years from now. There is a profound thoughtfulness and longevity to this design. Like an all-time great athlete, years past their prime, but still pulling their weight on the team, contributing something essential. This is backward compatibility Apple-style — not <em>technical</em> compatibility, but <em>experience</em> compatibility. The iPhone SE is the comfort iPhone.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘The 2022 iPhone SE’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/the_2022_iphone_se">★</a></p>

There were a lot of good, but old, 32-bit Mac apps that thus stopped running on Macs running the latest OS in 2019. But Apple silicon only supports 64-bit software. Forcing all current Mac software to transition to 64-bit even while all Mac hardware (based on Intel’s x86 architecture) was capable of running 32-bit software paved the way for a smooth transition from Intel to Apple silicon in 2020. Putting aside the fact that the best available ARM chips that aren’t from Apple are not very good for PCs, even if they were, there’s no way Microsoft could move the next major version of Windows exclusively to ARM.

<p>Fast forward to today, and here’s an update from <a href="https://twitter.com/twittersupport/status/1503443926258180106">Twitter Support</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We heard you –– some of you always want to see latest Tweets
first. We’ve switched the timeline back and removed the tabbed
experience for now while we explore other options.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d been playing around with this change on Twitter’s iPhone app all weekend, and I’m still confused. I <em>think</em> the way the new, now-abandoned (at least temporarily) timeline worked is as follows, but I’m not sure. “Home” is Twitter’s name for an algorithmically-generated timeline of “top tweets”. You get mostly tweets from popular accounts, including some, perhaps even many, that you don’t even follow, and the tweets appear in no discernible chronology. I see some tweets from minutes ago mixed in with tweets from almost 24 hours ago.</p>

<p>“Latest” is the timeline with tweets from accounts you follow, in chronological order. This is the feed that most long-time Twitter users think defines what Twitter is. (Both feeds get a slew of ads mixed in.)</p>

<p>The new feature defaulted to only showing you the “Home” timeline, but gave you an option to put a tab controller atop your feed with two options: “Home” and “Latest Tweets”. You could either tap or swipe to switch between them. But by default, the Home/Latest Tweets header wasn’t shown, and you <em>only</em> saw the algorithmic Home feed, with no indication that there was an option to switch. You had to go into the cryptically-iconned “✨” menu (the “sparkle menu”?), and tap “Pin your Latest timeline”, which was described thus: “The latest Tweets from people you follow will be one swipe away from Home.” </p>

<p>First, I had no idea what the hell the “✨” button did before this. I didn’t even know it was a button. What a bizarre icon for the options to control the essential nature of how you view Twitter. Not to be too cynical, but it feels like this icon choice was driven by a desire to hide this option while maintaining plausible deniability that the option had been hidden. “<em>It’s not hidden or buried in settings — it’s right there in the sparkle!</em>” The whole thing felt like using a Twitter app in a bad dream where you can’t figure out how anything works.</p>

<p>But the other thing is that by design, switching to “Latest Tweets” <em>didn’t stick</em>. The option to “pin” (another odd and confusing choice, that verb) “Latest Tweets” as a view you could swipe to stuck, but each time you opened Twitter, your main timeline defaulted to the algorithmic “Home” feed, and you needed to swipe to get to Latest Tweets. Many people check Twitter many times per day. It’s one swipe each time but that’s a lot of swipes in the aggregate, and the only reason it worked this way is that Twitter clearly wants to push people to the algorithmic feed to increase aggregate engagement. To hell with what users say they want to see.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that for most Twitter users — who use Twitter’s own app and who have no idea what’s in the sparkle menu — they no longer had a way to view the new tweets from the accounts they’ve chosen to follow. The default is to “unpin” the tweets you want to see. And even users who <em>did</em> know or learn about the “pin” setting inside the bananas sparkle menu got served the algorithmic “Home” feed <em>each time they opened Twitter</em>.<sup id="fnr1-2022-03-14"><a href="#fn1-2022-03-14">1</a></sup> How anyone at Twitter could not foresee that this would make people furious, I don’t know.</p>

<hr>

<p>After years of complaints that Twitter had stagnated, feature-wise, they’re now adding new and interesting features on a regular basis. Whether this is related to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/29/dorsey-agrawal-twitter">Jack Dorsey stepping down as CEO</a>, I don’t know, but until this timeline change, I liked what I’ve been seeing from Twitter lately. I subscribe to Twitter Blue for $3/month and I really enjoy it — particularly the “Top Articles” feed, which shows the articles that were most shared over the last 24 hours by the people you follow. Not the top articles shared by people chosen by an algorithm — the top articles shared by people <em>I</em> chose to follow. It’s the main reason I check the official Twitter app regularly, and it’s a pretty decent replacement for <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/05/05/nuzzel">Nuzzel, a dedicated app that Twitter acquired and shut down in May last year</a>. They’ve also <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/1502708341406986243">recently added a new “bookmarks” feature for tweets</a>, which lets you collect tweets to refer back to later. You’ve always been able to use “likes/favorites” for this, but bookmarks allows you to save tweets without any of the social aspects inherent to “liking” something. Twitter bookmarks are (I believe) completely private. Great feature.</p>

<p>My last takeaway from Twitter’s four-day venture into pretending to be Facebook (and that anyone who uses Twitter wants them to be Facebook) is that I’m surprised how many people clearly have no idea that excellent third-party Twitter clients exist, and that they not only don’t show this algorithmic drivel, they <em>can’t</em>.<sup id="fnr2-2022-03-14"><a href="#fn2-2022-03-14">2</a></sup> They don’t show you all those ads either. You just pay a few bucks — the price of a beer or a sandwich — and apps like <a href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> and <a href="https://twitterrific.com/">Twitterrific</a> make Twitter what you want Twitter to be. They even have great native apps for Apple’s up-and-coming Mac platform.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Twitter’s Confusing New, but Hopefully Now Abandoned, ‘Home/Latest’ Timeline’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/03/twitter_bananas">★</a></p>
