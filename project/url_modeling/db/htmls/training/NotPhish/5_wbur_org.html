Twenty five years later, Maria is on a quest to understand what it means to love, mourn and remember Selena. In this intimate journey, Maria explores what Selena's legacy shows us about belonging in America.","Editors’ Notes: Mexican-American recording artist Selena Quintanilla not only popularized Tejano music to mainstream American audiences, but also helped put Latinos on the map and broke barriers of all kinds before her untimely passing in 1995. Journalist María García initially took notice of her talent when she was only seven years old. “I couldn’t articulate this when I was younger, but I felt it—a profound sense that she mattered, not just because of her music but because of her expansive cultural impact,” García tells Apple Podcasts.","On her podcast Anything for Selena, Apple Podcasts’ Show of the Year of 2021, García, who most recently served as Managing Editor for Boston public radio station WBUR, combines rigorous reporting with impassioned storytelling to honor her legacy. She also explores the indelible mark she left on Latino identity and belonging, whether it’s fatherhood, big-butt politics, and the fraught relationship with whiteness and language. Though she sees the show as a personal journey “to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” García felt it was important to make sense of how she profoundly touched the hearts and minds of many. “It’s not a biography podcast. Instead, we tried to make meaning of Selena's life and legacy,” she says. “So many people wrote to me telling me the storytelling in the podcast made them feel seen.\""],"nprID":null,"sources":[],"hasLanding":true,"isSource":true,"archived":false,"facebookURL":"","twitterHandle":"@selena_podcast","syndicationURL":"","phone":"","email":"","airTimes":"","hostPhoto":null,"podcastRSS":"https:\u002F\u002Frss.wbur.org\u002Fanythingforselena\u002Fpodcast","podcastItunes":"https:\u002F\u002Fpodcasts.apple.com\u002Fus\u002Fpodcast\u002Fanything-for-selena\u002Fid1535265016","podcastGoogle":"https:\u002F\u002Fpodcasts.google.com\u002Ffeed\u002FaHR0cHM6Ly9yc3Mud2J1ci5vcmcvYW55dGhpbmdmb3JzZWxlbmEvcG9kY2FzdA","podcastStitcher":"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.stitcher.com\u002Fpodcast\u002Fwbur\u002Fanything-for-selena","podcastTuneIn":"","podcastSpotify":"https:\u002F\u002Fopen.spotify.com\u002Fshow\u002F1aCcf9CN3cunTBdkIzYTvo?si=rfPpWnCVR0KqJrwEP9MkkQ","podcastRadioPublic":"https:\u002F\u002Fradiopublic.com\u002Fanything-for-selena-GZQvY9","podcastNprOne":"","podcastEpisodeDesc":"","podcastUnpublish":false,"itunesType":"serial","itunesCategory":"Society & Culture","itunesSubCategory":"","itunesAuthor":"WBUR & Futuro Studios","itunesKeywords":"selena, Quintanilla, Maria Garcia, wbur, futuro"},"arts-culture":{"id":117,"title":"Arts & Culture","source":"arts-culture","description":"","type":"news-section","relativeURL":"\u002Fnews\u002Fsection\u002Farts-culture","apiURL":"http:\u002F\u002Fapi.wbur.org\u002Fchannels\u002Farts-culture","externalURL":null,"miniExcerpt":"","images":{"tile":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-200x200.jpeg","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-400x400.jpeg","width":400,"height":400},"medium_large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-768x768.jpeg","width":768,"height":768},"large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-1000x1000.jpeg","width":1000,"height":1000},"square":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-600x600.jpeg","width":600,"height":600},"breakout":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-1920x1920.jpeg","width":1920,"height":1920},"superbreakout":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture-2560x2560.jpeg","width":2560,"height":2560},"full":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002Ftile-arts-culture.jpeg","width":3000,"height":3000}},"app_banner":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_logo.png","width":1242,"height":3000}},"app_wallpaper":{"thumbnail":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern-200x200.png","width":200,"height":200},"medium":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern-400x966.png","width":400,"height":966},"medium_large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern-768x1855.png","width":768,"height":1855},"large":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern-1000x2415.png","width":1000,"height":2415},"square":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern-600x600.png","width":600,"height":600},"full":{"file":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2016\u002F06\u002FArtery_pattern.png","width":1242,"height":3000}}},"content":["The ARTery is your destination for news and thoughtful conversation about Boston’s arts and culture.

Many say the president has been too cautious, even as a majority say they're wary of sparking a broader conflict. ","\"The American people are supportive of Ukraine, up to a point,\" said Chris Jackson, a senior vice president at Ipsos, which conducted the poll. ","More than 6 in 10 Americans want the U.S. to give Ukraine some of the support it wants, while still trying to avoid a larger military conflict with Russia. Fewer than 2 in 10 say the U.S. should give Ukraine everything it wants, even if it risks a wider war. ","Those responses were remarkably consistent across the political spectrum with strong majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents all in agreement. But when Americans are asked to assess President Biden's performance, that bipartisan consensus breaks down. ","\"What he's doing is fundamentally what the American people want,\" Jackson said. \"But even if Biden is doing everything that people want to do, he's not going to get a lot of credit for it.\" ","\u003Ch3\u003EDisapproval is highest among Republicans \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","Overall, only 36% of Americans say Biden is doing a good job in response to the war in Ukraine, while 52% say he's not. That disapproval is driven largely by the GOP: 81% of Republicans rated Biden's response as fair or poor. On the other hand, 62% of Democrats described the president's response as good or excellent. ","And 45% of respondents say President Biden has been too cautious in supporting Ukraine. Only 7% think the U.S. should be doing less in Ukraine, compared with 39% who think it should be doing more.   ","The poll was conducted from March 18-21, before Biden \u003Ca href=\"\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F1087872606\u002Fbiden-and-u-s-allies-plan-to-step-up-sanctions-on-russia-over-its-war-in-ukraine\"\u003Etraveled to Europe\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to meet with NATO allies in an emergency session on the Ukraine war. ","Most Americans say they're paying close attention to Ukraine. More than 90% of respondents answered correctly that Russia invaded Ukraine, not the other way around. And more than 80% know that the U.S. has imposed economic sanctions in response. ","It appears that Russian disinformation campaigns have mostly failed to sway large numbers of Americans. For example, only 2% of poll respondents believe the \u003Ca href=\"\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F1083677765\u002Fputin-denazify-ukraine-russia-history\"\u003Efalse claim that Ukraine is governed by Nazis\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. ","However, another Russian conspiracy theory has gotten some traction.

Only 33% of respondents correctly identified that statement as false, while more than half say they don't know. ","\u003Ch3\u003EThere's broad support for Ukrainian refugees \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","The poll found bipartisan support for accepting Ukrainian refugees. ","Nearly 3 in 4 Americans say the U.S. should take in Ukrainian civilians fleeing the war in their country. That includes two-thirds of Republicans, who tend to be more skeptical of refugees and asylum-seekers. ","The poll was conducted before the Biden administration announced that the U.S. will welcome \u003Ca href=\"\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F1088506487\u002Fus-ukraine-refugees\"\u003Eup to 100,000 Ukrainians\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and other displaced people fleeing the conflict in Ukraine.","Support for Ukrainian refugees did not necessarily extend to other groups seeking protection in the U.S. When asked if the U.S. should admit Russians who voice opposition to their government, only 62% of Americans agreed. That was similar to the number who support admitting people fleeing violence in other parts of the world, including Afghanistan, Syria and Central America. ","\u003Ch3\u003EInflation tops the list of concerns \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","For all the attention on Ukraine, the crisis there is not a top concern for most Americans. ","Their biggest worry by far is inflation. In our poll, 40% of Americans — including 60% of Republicans — rate \"inflation or increasing costs\" as their top concern. Political extremism, crime and climate change were also high on the list. ","The poll suggests that inflation is overshadowing more positive news about the economy. Fewer than half of Americans think the unemployment rate is lower than it was a year ago (\u003Ca href=\"\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F1084299987\u002Femployers-jobs-february-labor-market-workers#:~:text=Hiring%20accelerated%20sharply%20last%20month,%2C%20from%204%25%20in%20January.\"\u003Eit is\u003C\u002Fa\u003E), and only 40% say wages are rising faster than they have in more than a decade (\u003Ca href=\"\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnpr\u002F1076514240\u002Fwill-rising-wages-push-inflation-even-higher\"\u003Ethey are\u003C\u002Fa\u003E). ","But Americans are extremely aware of rising costs: 94% say the cost of food, gas and housing has gone up in the past year. ","Nearly half of poll respondents say they've stopped driving long distances or made other changes because of rising costs. ","That includes Linda Kelly, a Republican from Topeka, Kansas, who participated in the poll. Kelly says she has limited her trips to Kansas City, about a 45 minute drive away, and is buying less beef because prices are up. ","\"I didn't get any pay raise or anything like that,\" Kelly said in a follow-up interview. \"My employer didn't offer us any bonus benefits to stay. And yet all these other things are going up, up, up. So I actually took a pay cut in the long run. So I think the economy right now sucks.\"","\u003Ch3\u003EThe blame for inflation breaks along party lines \u003C\u002Fh3\u003E","When it comes to assigning blame for inflation, the responses tend to break along partisan lines. Democrats point to a wide range of factors, including the war in Ukraine and lingering effects of the coronavirus pandemic. ","\"International and national events happened that just collided,\" Colleen Holland, a Democratic voter from Arlington, Va., said in a follow-up interview. \"You know, with Ukraine and Russia and, you know, the pandemic. But I don't blame the current administration.\" ","For Republicans, the calculus is simpler: 2 out of 3 say President Biden is most responsible for rising food and gas costs.

There wasn't a lot to suggest that he would step up in the way he has, that he would step into the shoes of a Winston Churchill, or something like that he's often been compared to in the past month. He did struggle with criticism. For all of his career, he was a beloved comedian. He was used to applause. Everyone liked him. Everywhere he went, people wanted his autograph. And then suddenly in the presidency, after the initial sheen of that enormous victory wore off a little bit and he was faced with the task of governing and trying to seek peace with Russia on terms that would not be humiliating to Ukraine, the honeymoon period was not long and people began to very harshly criticize him. His approval ratings dropped from upwards of 70% to down to 20% in some polls. ...","I did have my doubts as to how he would behave. But, man, he surprised me. He surprised a lot of people. I think he's been an absolute inspiration for Ukrainians and, honestly, for many of the Western leaders who might have even preferred to sit this one out or stay on the fence and not antagonize Russia. But because of his moral leadership, his wartime leadership, the power of his oratory and speechmaking in venues like the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress, it has made it politically and morally very difficult for Western leaders to not support him, to not really back Ukraine in this conflict.

And the idea of poisoning him and banning his organization, forcing all of his allies into exile, these kinds of really extreme steps that the Russian government took seemed really a bit crazy. It seemed unnecessary. But now with the hindsight we have of this war, it has seemed to me like the attack against the opposition, the attack against Navalny, was a premeditation for the war.","Clearly, Russia was planning this war for a long time.

That oil pipeline helped bankroll essentially the pro-Russian or Russian political operation in Ukraine. ... So Russia was trying to gain control of Ukrainian politics by fielding its own politicians, and Zelenskyy went after them.

The DOC maintains that the facility is a \"safe and healthy environment for employees, visitors\" and those in custody there.","The Disability Law Center (DLC) issued a report last month that found that Bridgewater workers often use \"chemical restraints\" or seclusion on those in custody and that there are structural problems within the hospital buildings.","\"The DOC carefully reviewed the report and disagrees with DLC's allegations that the condition of the physical plant is unsafe, that DOC's mold remediation work has been deficient, and that care of Persons Served is contrary to state law,\" said DOC Commissioner Carol Mici's \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2022\u002F03\u002FDOC-Response-to-DLC-BSH-Report-3-23-22.pdf\"\u003Eresponse\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to last month's report.","Mici's response noted that the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations reviewed Bridgewater in July 2021 and renewed Bridgewater's accreditation as a behavioral health hospital. Her letter also said the DLC report disregards work the department has done to improve the physical facility and there have been no complaints of respiratory illness because of mold or poor air quality. Mici said the DOC is working with an environmental consultant and replaced asbestos fittings and began an \"industrial quality cleaning\" of some of the hospital's mechanical areas earlier this month.","Mici wrote in her response that there has been a 51% drop in the use of restraints at Bridgewater since 2015. That was prior to reform efforts in 2017 and a new contract with the health care provider Wellpath to take over the care of people held at Bridgewater. Mici said the DLC report mischaracterized Emergency Treatment Orders, or ETOs, as a form of restraint, saying they are orders to involuntarily administer medication prescribed for a psychiatric disorder. Mici's letter promises a review of policies regarding restraints and regular audits of seclusion and restraints of those in custody at Bridgewater.","Bridgewater State Hospital is the state’s secure institution for people with severe mental illness, and most admitted there are involved in the criminal legal system. About 200 men are currently held there.","The Disability Law Center said it stands by its report on Bridgewater.","\"Our findings and recommendations are grounded in a mold expert's personal observations at Bridgewater State Hospital and laboratory testing of surface swab samples she took there, DLC's extensive review of records and contact with Persons Served, and a firm grasp of the history of the facility as well as applicable law,\" said a statement from DLC Interim Executive Director Tatum Pritchard."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"disableAds":"enabled","amp":false,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":64,"type":"category","name":"Crime & Justice","description":"","slug":"crime-justice","series":false,"count":10789},{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":63586}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":null,"images":[{"type":"featured","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fd279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net\u002Fwp\u002F2022\u002F02\u002FGettyImages-452185106.jpg","width":2794,"height":1863,"title":"Bridgewater State Hospital photographed in 2013.

This is in the range of what multiple studies in the U.K., Israel and the U.S. have found.","Ideally, long COVID should not be measured only a few months after the initial infection, he says. \"A lot of people are still slowly getting better, so you have to wait at least four months to sort of figure out whether or not these symptoms will persist.\"","The \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.medrxiv.org\u002Fcontent\u002F10.1101\u002F2022.01.05.22268800v2\"\u003EIsraeli study\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, conducted by Edelstein and his colleagues, followed several thousand people who were unvaccinated, partially vaccinated and fully vaccinated.

of long COVID.","\"The vaccines are supposed to protect you from being hospitalized,\" says Al-Aly. \"But even if they fail and you get breakthrough COVID and now you're hospitalized, you still do better than someone who got COVID and was never vaccinated.\"","Conflicting results in the studies may, in part, be due to how they're conducted, such as differences in the methods of measuring long

Putrino, director of rehabilitation innovation at Mount Sinai. \"The symptoms are very consistent.\"","And there's now another unresolved question facing researchers: How well do vaccines hold up against long COVID after an omicron infection?","Because omicron emerged at the end of last year, there isn't yet data on how many people have long COVID from the new variant, but Deeks says there are already some people who seem to be heading in that direction. \"Without question, there are clearly people — I'm hoping not a lot — who got COVID a few months ago and are feeling ill today,\" he says.","Based on what's known about the variant, no one really knows for sure whether people who get omicron could be more, or less, prone to getting long COVID.","On the one hand, omicron is adept at evading the immune defenses put up by the vaccines, so it's possible that \"we might end up with more long COVID,\" Deeks says.","Alternatively, the variant leads to a more localized infection and doesn't spread throughout the body as much, which means there could actually be fewer instances of long COVID.","Deeks is leaning toward the more optimistic scenario: \"That's my prediction, but it's

15 years before Herman Melville introduced the world to Moby Dick, a whaling ship from Massachusetts sank near the mouth of the Mississippi River.","Nearly 190 years later, experts say, it’s still the only whaler known to have gone down in the Gulf of Mexico, where the threat of enslavement at Southern ports posed a risk for Black and mixed-race men who often were part of whaling crews.","Researchers checking out odd shapes during undersea scanning work on the sandy ocean floor believe they've finally found the shipwreck about 70 miles (113 kilometers) offshore from Pascagoula, Mississippi. It was documented in February by remotely operated robots in about 6,000 feet (1,829 meters) of water.","Not much is left of the two-masted wooden brig thought to be Industry, a 65-foot-long (20-meter-long) whaler that foundered after a storm in 1836. An old news clipping found in a library shows its 15 or so crew members were rescued by another whaling ship and returned home to Westport, Massachusetts, said researcher Jim Delgado of SEARCH Inc.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"1\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","Melville’s “Moby-Dick; or, The White Whale,” published in 1851, told the story of American whaling from a Northeastern view. The discovery of Industry shows how whaling extended into a region where relatively little is known about whaling despite the Gulf’s extensive maritime history.","“The Gulf is an undersea museum of some incredibly well-preserved wrecks,” said Delgado of SEARCH Inc., who a few years ago helped identify the remains of the last known U.S. slave ship, the Clotilda, in muddy river waters just north of Mobile, Alabama.","The find also sheds light on the way race and slavery became entangled in the nation’s maritime economy, said historian Lee Blake, a descendant of Paul Cuffe, a prominent Black whaling captain who made at least two trips aboard the Industry.","Southern slave owners felt threatened by mixed-race ship crews coming into port, she said, so they tried to prevent enslaved people from seeing whites, Blacks, Native Americans and others, all free and working together for equal pay.","“There were a whole series of regulations and laws so that if a crew came into a Southern port and there were a large number of mixed-raced or African American crew members on board, the ship was impounded and the crew members were taken into custody until it left,” said Blake, president of the New Bedford Historical Society in Massachusetts. Black crew members also could be abducted and enslaved, she said.","Images of Industry captured by NOAA Ocean Exploration aboard the research ship \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Foceanexplorer.noaa.gov\u002Fokeanos\u002Fwelcome.html\"\u003EOkeanos Explorer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E show the outline of a ship along with anchors and metal and brick remnants of a stove-like contraption used to render oil from whale blubber at sea, elements Delgado described as key evidence that the wreck was a whaling vessel.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"caption\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The Industry photos pale in comparison to those recently released of \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fapnews.com\u002Farticle\u002Fernest-shackleton-endurance-ship-found-antarctic-4906562ce1c9d27ec472f628709073a8\"\u003EEndurance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which sank in 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) of frigid Antarctic water a century ago and is incredibly well preserved. Bottles believed to date to the early 1800s are visible around Industry, but no ship's nameplate; what appears to be modern fishing line lies near the metal tryworks used to produce oil from whale fat.","The Gulf was a rich hunting ground for sperm whales, which were especially valuable for the amount and quality of their oil, before the nation’s whaling industry collapsed in the late 19th century, said Judith Lund, a whaling historian and former curator at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts.","“In the 1790s there were more whales than they could pluck out of the Gulf of Mexico,” she said in an interview.","While at least 214 whaling voyages ventured into the Gulf, Lund said, ships from the Northeast rarely made extended port calls in Southern cities like New Orleans or Mobile, Alabama, because of the threat to crew members who weren't white. That may may have been a reason the whaling ship that rescued Industry's crew took the men back to Massachusetts, where slavery was outlawed in the 1780s, rather than landing in the South.","‘’The people who whaled in the Gulf of Mexico knew it was risky to go into those ports down there because they had mixed crews,\" said Lund."],"enhanced":false,"seriesMeta":null,"iframeHero":null,"postType":"post","isBreaking":false,"isDeveloping":false,"relatedLinks":[],"relatedLinksLabel":"Related:","broadcastType":"","broadcastDate":"","broadcastTime":"","itunesEpType":"","itunesEpNum":0,"itunesTitle":"","itunesSummary":"","itunesExplicit":false,"volume":3,"disqus":null,"enableComments":false,"googlePick":false,"suppressAudio":false,"disableAds":"enabled","amp":false,"audioDatetime":null,"pullquotes":[],"taxonomy":[{"id":73,"type":"category","name":"News","description":"","slug":"news","series":false,"count":63586}],"audio":[],"embedMeta":{"embed-1":{"id":1,"parentID":759415,"type":"caption","attributes":{"id":"attachment_759420","align":"alignnone","width":"1000","caption":"This mosaic image shows what researchers believe to be the site of the wreck.

Li Ziqi impresses millions with her videos where she seemingly makes everything from scratch with her own two hands]\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: I remembered that the the title at the time said that it was an exclusive interview, like no one had spoken to her and they'd, like, cracked her mysterious persona. And I found that fascinating. Like, why is she so mysterious? Like, why can't other people talk to her?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: So why \u003Cem\u003Ecan’t\u003C\u002Fem\u003E other people talk to her?","Ben: Well, you probably noticed in the videos, Amory, she doesn't talk very much at all in the videos, right? Like, she's very quiet. These are quiet videos, right?","Amory: Yeah.","Ben: I don’t think that’s always been super clear–why she's so reclusive. But stylistically, Li Ziqi practically never talks in her own videos. It’s just ethereal, traditional-ish Chinese music over the sounds of her gardening, chopping wood, cooking. And Yi-Ling thinks this is part of the influencer’s crazy popularity.","Amory: The fact that she doesn’t talk?","Ben: Yes.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: she barely ever says a word. And these videos and so language isn't a barrier. It's all very visual. And so like that just translates very well. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Translates to this international audience of millions and millions of people. That makes sense to me. But there's also this escape factor, too. Like she's not just popular because she doesn't talk. She's also showing this insanely perfect country living lifestyle.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: I was just like, maybe I'll speak with her one day, which I think was a mistake. I should have just spoken to her then.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Yes. A perfect country lifestyle which, Yi-Ling says is another factor in Li Ziqi’s meteoric rise in the last few years.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: she touched on a pretty global nerve, which is this universal urban malaise. This kind of frustration with living in a world of not only burnout and kind of profit seeking driven machines, but also in recent years, a Coronavirus that is, you know, constraining everyone's in their homes. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: That is a much better way of articulating what I was trying to articulate before where it's just like, I don't know what I just watched, but it's the meaning of life.","Ben: I know, right? It's sort of perfect in this time of quarantining, right? &mdash; that we would gravitate to somebody outside in nature. Nature is healing, right, and Li Ziqi... she is in that nature, but she's also reclusive. She doesn't talk to anyone, really. She doesn't really talk in her videos. She's like the polar opposite of the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=vZNjlBUlU6M\"\u003EBo Burnham special \u003C\u002Fa\u003E-- like, he's babbling in a room by himself about sending photos of his genitals on Instagram.","\u003Cb\u003E[Bo Burnham: (sings) You send me a peach, I send a carrot back. You send a ferris wheel; that’s pretty abstract.] \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: And like, she’s gently harvesting and washing mushrooms and not saying a thing. Which again, during Covid resonates, right? But there's there's this other interesting factor to this, which is at least, according to some people, a big number of leads, which is millions of followers, are not all from the country. They're city people.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn Morris: Li Ziqi is this intriguing rural perspective in a phenomena that is somewhat urban or somewhat centered in, yes, more urban environments.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Ok, so who’s this?","Ben: I’ll let him tell you.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: My name is \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.research.manchester.ac.uk\u002Fportal\u002Fcarwyn.morris.html\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn Morris\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cb\u003E. I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Manchester China Institute, University of Manchester. I am currently based in London and I am the adoptive father of two cats. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: So presumably while ensconced among his cat children, Carwyn has studied Li Ziqi. But he’s also looking in this bigger way at this potent online and offline mix of, shall we say, ingredients.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: Internal migration, food, instant messaging groups and activism. And then I kind of look at that across what I might call digital geographies, like thinking about digital territories and sovereignty and the internet. It's a bit of a mishmash of stuff, but I take a spatial approach to the internet and it sort of comes together in my writing–when I can ever manage to publish anything.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Carwyn seems to see Li Ziqi as in some ways this thoroughly Chinese influencer who has transcended China. Which in turn has also changed how she presents online.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: There's a positioning of her as a sort of  person who is famous outside of China. She has some sort of foreign flavor and some foreign popularity. She's often described as the most popular Chinese language YouTuber in the world.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: It’s interesting to hear all of this after watching what I just watched &mdash; and truly not looking at the view count &mdash; and then hearing, like,  \"You just watched one of the most influential YouTubers in China, which is a massive country that could swallow your own!\"","Ben: Yeah, yeah, totally. And a big part of this popularity is the sheer beauty and perfection in her videos. These things are objectively undeniably gorgeous. She's digging around in the dirt, right? She's planting garlic or whatever, performing this really difficult manual labor. And yet she's got this amazing raven-black long hair, her outfits are all simple and perfect, and it's a full on vibe.","Ben: And Carwyn says that Vibe has resonated with a specific set of people, migrants and others who have left the countryside in the last decade or so and come to the city to find opportunity.","Amory: Hmm. Tale as old as time.","Ben: Right, but in China, it’s a tale that in the last few decades is especially true. There’s been this explosion of the middle urbanite class.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: They've gone to these large cities to work. They're part of the rat race. They're hustling every day and they're utterly exhausted. And for some of these people, this idea of \u003Cem\u003Eleaving\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the urban sprawl, the rat race, is very appealing. I think that's a global phenomenon, really. And this is perhaps why Li Ziqi’s videos are popular globally as well.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Carwyn says Li Ziqi shows the beat-down viewer tired of the rat race that a different way of living is possible. But like so many of us who have imagined a simpler life… he says Li Ziqi’s videos don’t necessarily inspire city workers to quit and buy a farm.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: But they may in that case just be there to \u003Cem\u003Ecalm\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the urban worker. To think  at the end of the day when things are just not quite good enough anymore, you're at the end of your tether. Watching that video, having that calming effect might enable you to work for a bit longer. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Carwyn's point about like having this calming effect on the viewer that enables you to actually go back to work &mdash; something about that really struck a negative chord in me. I really found that description from him to be like the most dystopian thing I had heard in a long time. People move from the countryside to work in the city, they get ground down, and on their lunch break, in their free time, to help them pull their nose back on the grindstone, they watch a little Li Ziqi.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: But for anybody who has lived in rural China, they would know it's not, it’s not real. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen: Tell me more what you mean by \"not real.\"\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: They’re a montage at the beginning of a Disney film with the Disney Princess, really. You can imagine the this is the one of those videos is the beginning of the film, and then the person goes on. We realize the star of this video is actually a princess in the making or something will happen to her, and she will become the star of the film, right? So there is this sort of, yeah, Disney Princess-esque beauty, and the choreography of it all. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: She \u003Cem\u003Eis\u003C\u002Fem\u003E filming this. You know, it's not just like she found out later, like, \"Oh, you were watching me make my cucumber salad?!\" So that was never lost on me.","Ben: Yeah. Well, I mean, you're smarter than I am. But let's talk about fame for a minute. Like, I think one of the interesting aspects of internet fame–and also maybe fame before outside of the internet is that it's often described as sort of someone or something arriving at the exact right time.","Amory: So what came before that has set up leaves it to go stratospheric in your mind.","Ben: A lot of things. Including instant noodles and video games. And Carwyn says, China has this really long – in internet years – history of internet celebrity. And one big bump in that history was the beginnings of connecting online celebrities with online merchandising or online branding.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: A lot of early internet celebrities &mdash; I'm going to go for like the 2010s, when there were a lot of video focused internet celebrities &mdash; they were online gamers. They were streaming League of Legends, Dota 2, World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike, things like that online. And what they would have, they would have Taobao, the maybe, let's say, the Chinese equivalent of eBay mixed with Amazon. So they would have Taobao stores where they would sell pot noodles and they would sell mice and mouse pads and things like that. And that would be how they would get their income. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: All right, you with me so far here?","Amory: Yeah.","Ben: As her videos started to blow up, Li Ziqi also started to sell noodles online","Amory: Like, I can buy the noodles that she just made in that video?","Ben: You can buy them. But first of all, this isn’t that romanticized “I had no money so I ate Ramen every night” kind of noodle. This ridiculously perfect food. And it comes at 70-80 bucks for a couple of noodle packages. And this is part of her expansion as a global influencer brand with a fanbase that has some means. Li Ziqi’s backstory is a little convoluted. But she was supposedly making her videos by herself at the beginning, and eventually she got linked up with this influencer management company. Here’s the writer Yi-Ling again.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: All I know is that the talent management company is based in Hangzhou, and it's huge. And so they they manage a lot of influencers in addition to Li Ziqi, but apparently Li Ziqi was kind of like one of their largest.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: So as this influencer starts to really pop off, she’s got an online store, she’s got 27 million followers on China’s social media site Weibo, 17 million subscribers on YouTube to videos that get 40 million views a pop. She still looks the same in her pastoral bucolic setting, patiently making the most gorgeous food you’ve ever seen for the most intimate meals of all time. But there’s this kind of invisible machinery being erected around her.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: So she was, I would say, over the course of 2020-2021, just like slowly rising and fame making a brand for herself, you know, creating this shop on Taobao, becoming a household name, being called \"quarantine queen\" by like a New York Times cooking writer. And then like around about, I would say, July 2021 she just kind of stopped. And when you build that brand up to like such a scale like people are going to start missing you. And so that's when I started paying more attention to her story. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Oh, no. OK, so this is when she disappears and doesn't post anything else.","Ben: Yeah. Last summer, she disappeared. At least from the internet. And I'm going to give you a theory on why Li Ziqi, at the top of her game, went missing from the internet and her strange return... when we come back.","\u003Cb\u003E[SPONSOR BREAK]\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: OK, Amory, if you were to guess Li Ziqi’s background like her backstory before she became a Sichuan Province influencer, what would your guess be?","Amory: Well, she comes across as a mountain gal &mdash; of the land, for the land, knows all the mushrooms to pick. So I would say like, was raised by the cucumbers of the mountain.","Ben: Yeah, hahaha.","Amory: I'm close, right?","Ben: Well, so Li Ziqi was supposedly part of this massive migration in China that has happened over the last few decades. Have you been to China, Amory?","Amory: Oh, I have not. Someday.","Ben: So this year is is is the 20th anniversary of the only trip I've ever made to China.","Amory: Wow.","Ben: I went to the Great Wall as part of my trip. We were we were exploring the Great Wall in this sort of northwest region of China. You could say very vaguely. They took us down from the wall from this sort of official tour and walked us through a village in the valley below the Great Wall. And you know, these are farms with dirt floors. You know, this is like people with, you know, maybe their entire house is, I don't know, fifty square feet. They have one pig, right? In my limited, very limited experience. This is what I would say is sort of the most humble existence of all of humanity that I have ever witnessed personally. And the last twenty years has been part of this intense transformation in China, right? Like a lot of it has been effectively driven by capitalism. But a lot of it has been at the direction of the the Chinese Communist Party, which would probably say, \"No, no, no, we're not capitalists. The People's Republic of China is a socialist market economy.\" Whatever you call it, it's the reason for a huge push in the recent past to get Chinese people out of the countryside and into the city. And it's done this through sort of public relations campaign pushing, among other things, a lot of opportunities for migrant workers. And Yi-Ling says this push worked.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: When we see the rising skylines, you know, in Shanghai and just like the highways and you know, all that kind of like trope images that we think of when we think of China's growth, so much of that was fueled by the millions &mdash; hundreds of millions &mdash; of migrant workers who moved kind of &mdash; it's called going out, right? &mdash; l\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Cb\u003Eeft home in search of better opportunities. But, you know, at a certain point in like a country's economic history, you just reap all the benefits of that growth. Like, the buildings have been built, the super highways have been built, and you know, the factories are now full and there is kind of a plateau. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: So Li Ziqi was presumably one of these migrant workers who decided the city was not for her, and she moves out west and buys a farm?","Ben: Right, so she starts in the countryside, she moves to the city and then she moves back to the countryside. And we don't know why she moved back, for sure, but, for a lot of the people who picked up and moved to the cities, this social divide popped up between migrant workers, people who are coming into the cities and locals. That's connected to this broader sort of view. Here's our internet-y geographer Carwyn.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: The countryside in modern China has often been painted as a backward place. And to be from the countryside has almost been a slur of sorts. Or at least it's been a very derogatory term used against people. You're from the countryside, or you are you're a peasant. You don't know anything. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: The sort of country bumpkin sort of insult. But I'm having so many thoughts about this.","Ben: Go on.","Amory: Because, you know, to take a country way of living and give it a platform on the internet, is like a meeting of the worlds in a way that maybe the powers that be in China didn't expect to be so desirable or influential.","Ben: You're absolutely on the right track here. OK. And what's wild is that in China, I think it's fair to say the intensity of government control has also made for some whiplash, and in some ways, the government is grappling with this. Yi-Ling says that 2021 some more dramatic and drastic societal change than the previous five years. And back in the 1980s, the previous party chairman, Deng Xiaoping, had a mantra that was to get rich is glorious. So it was all about the market economy moving into cities, you know, like this sort of thing. But under Xi Jinping, the new leader, the government now has has a different plan.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: They have decided to shift years and realized that in the wake of kind of huge rural urban socioeconomic inequality, the move is now to clamp down on kind of uninhibited growth. To clamp down on kind of a capital run amok and to ensure the \"common prosperity of all.\" \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: OK. So Yi-Ling never got to interview the massively popular Chinese pastoral princess, the quarantine queen. But she feels like she didn’t miss out, either.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: Basically when I started wanting to write about her, the story was unfolding. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Li Ziqi’s silence on her various platforms got a ton of attention. There were reddit threads. Conspiracy theories. A number of them referenced a history in China, starting with a far reaching wipe of influencers off the internet about ten years ago.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: Many of the large influencers who had built  up large followings and arguably larger power bases, at least to influence the discourse within society, found their accounts banned or suspended and their platforms taken away. And then things have evolved slightly under Xi Jinping. One of the first things that Xi Jinping did upon coming into power was to say to the media, \"You need to support the party.\" And since then, there has been a growing  party influence over a variety of new forms of media.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Even as this influence has happened, Amory, the internet in China has also just kind of gone bonkers in its scale and popularity.","Amory: And presumably, or maybe it's not fair to presume this, but maybe gone rogue as well?","Ben: Yeah, well, it's unwieldy, right? It's insanely popular and you know, people become insanely popular on the Chinese internet, very fast. Over the last 10 years, U.S. tech companies and social media companies have tried to gain a strong foothold there, but they haven't had much success. And these homegrown companies like \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.bytedance.com\u002Fen\u002F\"\u003EByteDance\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, which owns TikTok, have exploded, as have influencers in China.  And so more recently, even in the last six months, there has been another spate of influencers getting wiped off of the internet in China for reasons that people have speculated have to do with not being in alignment with the government's priorities.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: Examples of people who have been gotten. There is this celebrity called a very famous actress called \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com\u002Fnews\u002Fgeneral-news\u002Fvicky-zhao-wei-1235004160\u002F\"\u003EZhao Wei\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who just like overnight, all of her stuff disappeared off what Weibo, which is kind of like the social media website called China's Twitter. Like just any mention of her. She's like, It's like Angelina Jolie, just like disappeared off Twitter, kind of.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen: Scrubbed, fully scrubbed. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: Exactly, exactly. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: So I’m guessing Li Ziqi is one of these influencers getting disappeared from the internet?","Ben: This is where again I think the story takes an interesting turn. A few months after she disappeared, Li Ziqi came \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Posting a message to social media that was weird.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: She put out some cryptic messages where she was like, \"Capital is so annoying\" or like, \"Capital sucks.\" And like, posted a selfie of herself outside a courtroom. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: She replied to a comment on Weibo complaining about the dirty tricks of capital. She deleted the comment.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: What does that make you think of?","Amory: It's like a cry for help. You know, maybe not necessarily that she - I hope she's not in any physical danger &mdash; but it's like a -","Ben: So I think Amory a lot of people, including me, believed Li Ziqi had been effectively got by the Chinese Communist Party and reprogrammed. But our experts think it’s more complicated. Li Ziqi’s back-to-the-land brand actually lines up perfectly with the government’s goal of moving millions of migrants \u003Cem\u003Eback\u003C\u002Fem\u003E into the countryside. And the comments Li Ziqi made online about capital seem to actually just be about a money fight she’s having with her influencer management company about who gets a cut of what from her growing influencer empire. That fight \u003Cem\u003Ealso\u003C\u002Fem\u003E lines up with a recent Chinese Communist Party theme of distrusting tech and influencers. So the Government seems to be maybe throwing its support behind Li Ziqi, and \u003Cem\u003ELi Ziqi\u003C\u002Fem\u003E might actually be cool with that because it lines up with her \u003Cem\u003Eown\u003C\u002Fem\u003E needs right now.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: Because there's been a broader push back against maybe toxic or unethical or using the word that is coming in for Chinese vulgar influencers and celebrities and the companies that are managing them. This would show that  they are supporting the average person, the average rural person, the self-made woman, in the face of the exploitative capitalists and the exploitative companies.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: And Yi-Ling says Li Ziqi knows this. And understands the way that China’s influencer economy is fundamentally unique.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: I guess the the key difference between the Chinese internet ecosystem and the one it's in the United States is that it has to respond to the state, right? But both of them, at the end of the day, respond to market logic. So there is they respond to the market, both of them. But in China, there's this kind of extra hot sauce of like state control.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: OK. Number one, you got to love a hot sauce reference in a story about an influencer from the Sichuan Province.","Ben: Right?","Amory: But number two, this is so confusing. It's like, make up your mind. Do you want people in the country? Do you want them in the city? You want them back in the country? Do you want them to be successful? Not too successful. Like rein it in, you know?","Ben: They literally have a points system for living in a city for being effectively allowed to be a permanent resident of a city, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.businessinsider.com\u002Fchina-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4\"\u003Eyou have to score points in order to be a local\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. And so Li Ziqi might not be being forced to be a mouthpiece for the government. She's actually she's sort of like evolving her influencer status and she is opting in.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: My interpretation of it obviously hard to tell who's coming in and saying, what is that? She read the winds quite shrewdly. And like, I don't think she did anything that deserved punishment if anything like she was following the book, like pretty closely. And she just decided, Hey, like all these influencers are getting axed, maybe I should like do my extra bit and stand up and say, like, I actually don't want to be an influencer. That's like the, you know, shrewd political reading of it. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen:  The new influencer move is to refuse that they're an influencer.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: Exactly. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: So I think that you’ve given us a good sense of this one influencer’s story. But you promised something about the future of the internet.","Ben: Yeah I did. So For Carwyn’s part, he thinks Li Ziqi is maybe representing the end of an era.","\u003Cb\u003ECarwyn: Actually, on Douyin, Chinese Tik Tok, Li Ziqi’s videos are all very short. I wonder, I guess, if Li Ziqi has come along at a time when this form of the medium is at its peak. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Yi-Ling is doing a lot of thinking right now about the history of China's internet again, and about what that tells us about where we're headed next.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: I've been starting to kind of place Li Ziqi in the context of kind of influencers of her clout in the last 20 or so years of the history of the Chinese internet. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: \u003Cem\u003EThe\u003C\u002Fem\u003E female internet celebrity, says Yi-Ling, has had several different eras.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: China's first internet celebrity was a migrant worker from Shanxi, who became famous for kind of trying to get into like big city universities and posting these like lewd, provocative videos of herself dancing in cities. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: So there we've got this person who is headed \u003Cem\u003Eto\u003C\u002Fem\u003E the city and letting loose. That's what her influencer personality is about to the young generation that was chasing wealth and opportunity and freedom in the urban landscape.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: She was like popular among university students who were just like, Wow, this woman is so bold and provocative and crass and vulgar. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Then you have a new female cultural identity emerge in China. It matures a bit, graduates, but stays in the city.","\u003Cb\u003EYi-Ling: And then fast forward to 2016-2015, which I think of as the kind of height of the influencer economy.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E \u003Cb\u003EYou have a woman named Poppy, who was huge, and she put out these very short videos, mostly on Weibo. She was like the Shanghai urbanite &mdash; fast talking, very smart, kind of like stand up comedy, but online &mdash; who like poked fun at like, you know, like misogyny in everyday life. And just like the daily grind of being a white collar worker. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: And now…","Amory: ...

Welcome to the Endless Thread podcast waves.","Ben: Welcome, welcome.","Quincy: Thank you. It's nice to surf them.","Amory: We have some stories today about pets to share with you.","Ben: And Quincy, you got a story for us today, a story about a dog and a drone?","Quincy: Yeah. Well, so the drone is a very small part of this story. I think the internet kind of leaned toward the drone aspect of it...","Quincy: So this is a story about a man named Brad and his mastiff dog named Moose, who loved people. And Brad says Moose had a bubbly personality that made him a magnet wherever he went.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: Moose had that mentality of the abominable snowman off of Looney Tunes. Where did he go, George? Where did he go? That was that was Moose's mentality. You know, he was just such a goofy, laid back, chill dog.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: I like this guy already.","Quincy: And Brad sent us several videos where Moose is just laying down, gently playing with and being being antagonized by a cat about an eighth of his size. And that's one of the things Brad admired about Moose because they met about four years ago under kind of violent circumstances.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: I was on a trip in Alabama and I had saw somebody abusing him really bad. And I told the people that, I mean, I saw him literally kick this dog off the porch. And yeah, when I saw I pulled up in the driveway and I told the I told the man, I said, Man, look, you can either tell the cops of stealing your dog or you can just give me that dog because you're not going to treat a dog like that. And he ended up just saying, take them, he's yours. I don't want them. I said, OK. So I had I had brought them home. He was kept in a cage for the first six months of his life, so he had a twisted spine. So he had a he had a pretty rough life when I when I met him.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Wow. Sounds like this guy saved his life.","Quincy: Yeah, and it might sound cheesy, but in a way, Brad kind of feels like Moose ended up saving his life because he too. Eight months later would find himself getting severely injured by a car, hitting him while he was riding his motorcycle.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: I was run over by an SUV. Through my recovery stage, Moose was there. And just me also being there for him, knowing that I'm helping him recover because he's being shown love, he's being shown unconditional love, he's being shown what it means to be part of a family.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Quincy: So Brad and Moose did everything together, but a week before Thanksgiving, Moose and Brad were taking a walk in Inkster, Michigan, and then they stopped at a nearby gas station so Brad could get some cigarettes.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: and when I walked into the gas station, I had seen a gentleman being very aggressive and almost abusive towards a lady. So I stepped in and I said, Look, man, you know, you can't be doing this It's not right. This that and the other. Well, he called his buddy up, and when he called his buddy up, he came up and showed up with a gun and he pointed the gun in my face. so I left the store where I left the store and I went across the street and I called the cops, so about 10 minutes later, the police officer shows up. No lights on. Nothing, you know, just shows up. And he gets out of the car.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Quincy: And so this is where the drone comes in. So what happens next\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=JN--84SNFC4\"\u003E is captured via a drone\u003C\u002Fa\u003E flown by a security guard at a nearby dispensary. And in the footage in the center of the screen, you can see Brad talking to a cop who's standing next to the patrol car that's parked in the middle of a street, and Moose is walking slowly about 20 yards away on the right side of the screen. And there is no audio, but Brad looks towards Moose, and Moose sits down on the sidewalk, and then a pedestrian comes from the left side of the screen and then Moose gets up. And he walks towards the pedestrian to sniff him, and he's wagging his tail and he's not on a leash.","Amory: Moose on the loose.","Ben: Uh oh.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: And then he. My dog started walking towards me. And when Moose got right behind me, the officer had already had his gun pulled, pointing it at me and moose. And by the time Moose had gotten to just just to the left side of left side of me, the officer had started pulling the trigger and he actually he unloaded the clip, but he shot him four times. He hit him twice in the chest, once in the head and once in the arm–once in the leg and. As I was, I'm screaming to the officer, please stop, please stop, he's friendly, he's friendly, he's friendly. The officer just kept shooting and kept shooting. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Geez","Amory: WHAT.","Ben: This is insane.","Quincy: Brad says he filed a Freedom of Information Act to get the body cam footage and the cops dash cam footage. But he says he's been told by the Inkster Police Department that the body camera wasn't functioning and that the dash cam wasn't recording since the cops sirens weren't on. And the Inkster Police Department released a statement saying something along the lines of the loss of any pet is saddening, but owners need to have their pets leashed, \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.legislature.mi.gov\u002F(S(5tzkmbgfist0p4drq2lknqc1))\u002Fmileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-287-262\"\u003Eand it's a law in Michigan\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: he was not on a leash, which I was wrong for not having him on a leash, but still doesn't justify what happened.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: OK, so wait, I have a question. There's no dashcam footage and the body cam wasn't turned on or something like that, right?","Quincy: Right.","Amory: So the footage, the only footage that we have is because of this drone. So the significance of the drone is like the drone is proof that this happened","Quincy: Exactly.","Amory: Other than Brad obviously being there and witnessing this. Oh, Moose!","Quincy: Yeah. So Brad says he feels like Moose approached the cop just to make sure that, you know, the cop wasn't a threat. Just looking out for his buddy and maybe, you know, trying to get a pat on the head or something, too. But the day after the shooting, Brad visited the spot where Moose was shot. And then a man approached him and it was the security guard with the drone. So local news stations reported that the nearby dispensary that employed this security guard told him that if he shared the video footage of the incident, he would be fired. And so with that knowledge, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wxyz.com\u002Fnews\u002Fman-loses-job-over-video-of-police-officer-fatally-shooting-dog?fbclid=IwAR2Swy-qHfcSE5QTBj-QNmleTAGGkLWql8g9yVeGF_NrIYWBkmr8YyMzbPE\"\u003Ethe security guard handed over the footage to Brad, and subsequently he lost his job.\u003C\u002Fa\u003E","Amory: Wow.","Quincy: Yeah.","Ben: That's like a very, it sounds like that's a very principled and difficult choice for the security guard.","Quincy: Right. And the security guard also has an interesting story. I think he was recently released from prison for either murder or manslaughter, but that was because his mom was being abused and he defended himself and his mom. And so a lot of people have been, you know, trying to reach out to this security guard. But Brad said he hasn't even been able to contact him again. But a few days later, after, you know, his best friend was shot and killed with the emotional wounds still fresh, Brad got a ticket in the mail and and then he called the local courthouse to get an explanation for it.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: Actually, the the clerk told me that it wasn't necessarily a ticket, it was actually a misdemeanor charge for “Malicious dog at large.”\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Oh, my God. A dog not on a leash becomes “malicious dog at large.”","Ben: You know, I will say that in my like recent adult experience, some of the most contentious community issues in my world are pet related. And there is there are a lot of people out there who are easily triggered by a pet off its leash. And as a person whose kid was recently head-butted by a boxer that was off its leash in the park, I understand that concern. And at the same time, this seems like clearly the officer's reaction was, you know, ridiculously over the top and awful.","Amory: Oof. Sadness.","Ben: But it also strikes me that like there's a lot one through line here is abuse, right? Like abuse of the dog. Abuse of power. Abuse of, you know, somebody who who went to jail because of a situation that sounds like it arose from abuse. Man, abuse of people, animals power, all of these things just create more bad things.","Quincy: Right. And you know, Brad doesn't want that to be the end of the story.","\u003Cb\u003EBrad: Boy, Moose was so loving and caring and just happy go, lucky boy. So I want his story to touch as many hearts as possible and in that aspect. It has already come true because I \u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fanimalpetitions.org\u002F1066761\u002Fdog-reportedly-shot-to-death-by-police-officer-deserves-justice\u002F\"\u003E\u003Cb\u003Ehave  all over the nation\u003C\u002Fb\u003E\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003Cb\u003E sending me messages on Facebook, Hey, we heard your story.

So we have two workplace cats in one area of our work site. They add value to the work site. We all love the cats and the work site. Cat presence is not the issue. One of the cats, Jean, is a tortoiseshell cat we've had for years. The other cat, Jorts, is a large orange cat and a recent addition Jorts is just kind of a simple guy. For example, Jorts can't open the door even when it's ajar. He shoves it whether he is going in or out. So often he closes the door he is trying to go through. This means he's often trapped inside a place he was trying to exit in the hours until he's rescued. My colleague, Pam (not her real name) has been spending a lot of time trying to teach Jorts things. The doors thing is the main example. It is a real issue because the cats are fed in a closet and Jorts keeps pushing the door closed. So this seems easy to resolve. I put down a doorstop. Pam then said I was depriving Jorts of the quote \"chance to learn\" and kept removing the doorstop.","Ben: Are you guys with me so far here?","Quincy: Yeah, I think so.","Ben: So you got two cats, Jean and Jorts...","Quincy: and a Pam","Ben: and Pam, a coworker. And then the person who's telling the story.","Amory: And a doorstopper","Ben: Pam set up a series of special learning activities for Jorts and tried to put these tasks on the whiteboard of daily team tasks.","Amory: Oh my god, Pam, does have an actual job at this establishment?","Ben: It gets better. This person writes in parentheses: “I erased them.\"","Quincy: Oh, no.","Ben: \"Now I love Jorts, but he's just dumb AF and we can't change that. Don't get me wrong, watching her try to teach Jorts how to walk through a door is hilarious, but Jean got locked in the closet twice last week. Yesterday, I installed a cat cutout thing in the door and Pam started getting really huffy. I made a gentle joke about, 'You can't expect Jeans tortoiseshell smarts from orange cat Jorts,' which made Pam furious. She started crying and left the hallway, then sent an email to the group, including volunteers, and went home early. In her email, Pam said I was “perpetuating ethnic stereotypes” by saying orange cats are dumb and is demanding a racial sensitivity training before she will return. I don't think it's relevant, but just in case Pam is a white person in a mostly minority staff. And no, she is not ginger (does not have red hair). That's a parenthetical. TLDR: Am I the asshole for “Enforcing an ethnic stereotype by joking that orange cats are often dumb?”","Quincy: No.","Amory: Quincy's just going to tell it like it is.","Ben: He really is. Thank you, Quincy.","Quincy: No, we're just pretty strong.","Ben: Pretty straightforward answer, right?","Quincy: I guess my my concern is that if Pam wants there to be a racial sensitivity training based on the fur color of a cat, I feel like...","Ben: Pam needs that training.","Quincy: Yeah. Like, I don't know she like under-... Is she the cat? I don't.","Ben: Yeah. So I couldn't agree more. Quincy and I think most of the responses were to that effect. So you guys ready for the update?","Ben: \"Thank you for responding to my query, which had truly upset me. I work to have a good relationship with my team, and the situation had gotten weird so gradually that I lost perspective. I just met with H.R. and she had already met with Pam. H.R. was concerned about Pam's comparing ethnic stereotypes with giving a cat a doorstop, and they addressed that which went well. H.R. also addressed Pam, assigning other staff Jorts-related-tutoring, as it is not appropriate for a Pam to assign others work. Pam got emotional about her perception that I favor Jean over Jorts, and gave specific examples. Some of these things are fair.","A) Jean has a nice cat bed with her name on it, while Jorts has chosen an old boot tray in my office with a towel in it. Recently, a visitor put wet boots in the boot tray and Pam saw Jorts sleeping on the wet boots. I bought a bed for Jorts today and the name tag has been ordered.","B) I will apologize to Jorts and remove the sign, saying quote “days since Jorts has had a trashcan mishap. Zero.”","C) Jean's staff bio has a photo of Jean, while Jorts’ bio has a photo of a sweet potato. I did not actually know either cat had a staff bio, but we will use a photo of Jorts instead of a sweet potato….","Ben: So this person is giving concessions, which is good.","Ben: H.R. also suggested changing Pam's duties, so she is “in charge of the cats.” This, I refused. The cats are my staff, not Pam. I think Pam was well-intentioned, but actually not meeting the needs of either Jean or Jorts, so they remain under my supervision. Lastly, and this made us both laugh so hard, we can't deal with it in person, and it will be said via email:","Pam admits that she has been putting margarine on Jorts in an attempt to teach him to groom himself better. Oh, this may explain the diarrhea problem Jean developed, which required a vet visit. Pam is \u003Cem\u003Enot to apply margarine to any of her coworkers\u003C\u002Fem\u003E. Jean has shown she is willing to be in charge of helping Jorts stay clean. If this task becomes onerous for Jean, we can have a groomer help. I'm crying, laughing, typing this.","Quincy: Is this real? Is this a real thing?","Amory: Who knows? To the extent that people post truthful things on Reddit.","Ben: Yes, the top comment here says, “I can't believe she f****** buttered Jorts.”","Amory: She margarine-d Jorts. It's very different.","Ben: Spoken, spoken like a true vegan.","Amory: Ben, I may or may not have just changed your staff photo to sweet potato.","Amory: All right, so we've had a dog. We've had a couple of cats, and now I have another pet related story about a different species. And my story comes from Facebook \u003Cem\u003Evia\u003C\u002Fem\u003E Twitter. So \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Flrmayer?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003EI saw this quote tweet from Laura Mayer\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who makes podcasts for a company called Three Uncanny Four. And the tweet read, “I request a podcast on this topic,” and the topic \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fthnk1994\u002Fstatus\u002F1473342204017930243?s=12\"\u003Ewas a tweet from something called the Think 1994 Museum Twitter account\u003C\u002Fa\u003E. Do you guys know this one?","Quincy: No.","Ben: No.","Amory: It is like a museum is an apt term. They post a bunch of funny pictures with captions, often pictures of celebrities. But in this case, it was a screenshot of a post made on Facebook, and this post was made by a woman named Tiana Harris. And it reads, “Does anyone have a connection to Reese Witherspoon or her PR team? My horse was stolen in 2008, and someone just sent me this pic of her \u003Cem\u003Ewith my horse\u003C\u002Fem\u003E!!” Two exclamation points.","Quincy: Oh wow.","Amory: \"Help! I'm sure she wasn't aware, but I'd love to find him.\" So then of course, there's this picture of Reese Witherspoon kind of tenderly cradled up next to the horse's head. It's a beautiful horse, and it is kind of like a unique coloring for a horse, I would say. So I get that if your horse was stolen and you see a picture like this, you're like, Oh my God, that is Reese Witherspoon with my horse. And so at first I'm thinking, \"OK, I'm going to reach out to Reese Witherspoon somehow, and I'm going to blow her mind that she is in possession of this stolen horse.\" So my first step was to DM the Think 1994 museum account, because I don't know where they got this picture. It's just a screenshot of a Facebook post. So I reached out to them and I'm like, \"Whaaat? Where did this come from? Do you know Tiana Harris, this woman who claims Reese Witherspoon stole her horse?\" They said, No, we just we're making celebrity posts with horses, and this came up in Google. And then they linked me to someone in the comments of the tweet, who they said probably has some connection.","Amory: So that person on Twitter goes by Laura Lux. Do you guys know who Laura Lux is?","Ben: No.","Amory: OK. I didn't, either. I feel a little less ancient, not knowing who she is. She has like 700,000 \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fdarthlux?lang=ga\"\u003ETwitter followers\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and I don't want to mischaracterize her profession, I think she is a model, but she heavily promotes an Only Fans account.","Quincy: She's a content creator.","Amory: Yes.","Ben: Have you have you looked at her OnlyFans account?","Amory: I clicked on it. Yeah, I was like, I think I know what OnlyFans is. She's a content creator. Very popular. \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FDarthLux\u002Fstatus\u002F1473704641057669122?s=20\"\u003ESo here's what she comments in the Twitter thread. She says, “Oh my God, I was in the Facebook group where this all went down and it was insane. LMAO\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.”","Amory: \"I wish I could remember the details, but it was so long ago. I know it wasn't her horse in the photo with Reese, and it turned out her horse had died years before. But this girl refused to believe that Reese Witherspoon did not steal her horse.\"","Ben: Wow.","Quincy: Wow.","Amory: So I reached out to Laura Lux. Even though her Twitter bio says no DMs, I immediately DM her. I'm like, “Do you know who Tiana Harris is? Do you know anything more about what happened? What was this Facebook group?” And so she writes me back, and she says “it was so long ago it happened in a Facebook group called Girls Night Out,” which I also can't tell what that is. But she describes it as an LA-based networking group for women, but turned kind of toxic. And I think she left the group. So she does a little digging on my behalf and she goes back into the Girls Night Out group, and \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FDarthLux\u002Fstatus\u002F1473785249599574016?s=20\"\u003Eshe finds the original post by this woman\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, who now goes by Tiana Cooper, and there are two edits to the post. So the first one says, \"This horse is in New Zealand or Hawaii and is most likely not my horse. Thank you for investigating, ladies. I'll keep looking.\"","Amory: And when she says thank you for investigating ladies, that refers to edit number two, which calls out one woman in particular who found the guy who had her actual horse. And the horse did pass away in 2010, and Tiana said that she was devastated but glad to have some closure. So I'm still trying to find out exactly how these women found the person who had her actual horse. If there are updates, you will be the first to know","Quincy: This is equestrian noir.","Ben: I guess it would have been more delicious if Reese Witherspoon was a horse thief. You know?","Amory: Well, who knows where that horse in New Zealand or wherever it was came from. Maybe she was curling up next to a stolen horse. It's just not this woman's stolen horse. So, Reese, we're on to you.","Ben: Yeah, somebody somebody checked the VIN number on those horses that Reese has.","Ben: All right. Quincy, Amory, good to talk pets with you guys.

I remember being very struck, standing in the shadow of a brontosaurus skeleton.

She writes about it and tweets about it. Online, she exists in multiple worlds. And multiple dinosaur communities.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: A lot of it is very professionalized people talking about their new papers and new studies coming out in their latest field expedition. There's also a broader community of dinosaur and paleontology enthusiasts, people who just like to know more, or they were inspired by \u003Cem\u003EJurassic Park\u003C\u002Fem\u003E, and they want to find out the real stories behind these animals.

Whenever I talk about it, I use a little dinosaur emoji, a comet emoji, a plant emoji and a raccoon emoji to kind of tell that story of like the dinosaurs going extinct and plants and mammals coming back afterwards and just having fun like with storytelling. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: But a few months ago, Riley started to see dinosaur emoji that weren’t so fun.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: I think my initial knee-jerk reaction, um, was just like, Well, you can't have them. Like dinosaurs are ours.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: The T. Rex and brachiosaurus were showing up in the profiles of a different online community. Kind of as a badge. A dog whistle to say to others within that community: I’m one of you.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: It really just made zero sense to me whatsoever in terms of like, you know, they could have picked anything else and it might have made a little bit more sense to me. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Riley refers to the group of co-opters as TERFs, as in T-E-R-F. Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists, who call themselves “gender critical.” In other words, anti-trans.","Broadly speaking, TERFs promote the idea that trans women are really men—that, unlike cisgender women, trans women have benefited from being a part of the patriarchy and thus are a threat to cis women. Above all, they say that, unlike sex, gender identity is an ideology and is not grounded in science. We’ll come back to this.","Ben: You may recall the most famous or infamous person associated with TERF ideology is \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nytimes.com\u002F2020\u002F06\u002F12\u002Fstyle\u002Fjk-rowling-transgender-fans.html\"\u003EJ.K. Rowling\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, the Harry Potter author. Among other things, in 2020, she published a 3700-word essay defending her belief that the term “‘woman’ as a political and biological class” was being “eroded” by people who refer to trans women as women.","Anyway, TERFs using dinosaur emoji was a problem for Riley.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: To see, you know, our social enemies for lack of a better term taking, you know, these symbols and trying to use it as their dog whistle, it was something where it's just like, Where's this even coming from? This makes zero sense. And also dinosaurs are ours. I hate to speak for the entire trans or genderqueer community but, like, no. We’ve already been wondering about them and drawing them and interested. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: No matter who you are, if you see something beloved taken over by someone else, that can be hard. Suddenly, genderqueer fans of dinos everywhere felt under attack as TERFs kept dropping the emoji into their feeds.","Ben: And we know how these things go. Just think of Pepe the frog.

So, he responded … calling out his colleagues on the right and in his own party for being anti-trans. He called them dinosaurs. As in, behind the times.","Amory: This was not big news.

It would be comical… if it weren’t in service of one group rejecting another’s identity.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy Burge: I feel like the first time we really saw the double meaning of the emoji has to be the eggplant.  \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: There is one guy you have to call if you want to understand emoji.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: They felt like an odd choice to put on the emoji keyboard, so people kind of immediately saw that and said, “That’s funny.

Emojipedia describes every emoji, what it looks like, what it looks like on all platforms. And for me, I oversee a small team of people who do exactly that describe how people use emojis and how they evolve over time. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: We asked Jeremy, how common is this? Emoji double-meanings used like a badge…","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: These days, we have plenty of alternative meanings that you do see Twitter bios, people put an emoji up. There is sort of an identity. You'll see the American flag is quite popular among generally conservative Americans. There's a rose emoji which fans of Bernie Sanders and sort of us style democratic socialism in general. You'll see them put that in their Twitter bio, and then you get other really niche sorts of ones in Australia. That was a big water scandal, and people started putting a water drop in their Twitter bio, and I don't know. You find that maybe a more aggressive group of people start using it and then you can't use that in your bio anymore because you feel like you'll be grouped in with people you don't want to be. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Amory did you know about all those?","Amory: Ben, did I know about \u003Ci\u003Eany\u003C\u002Fi\u003E of those?","Ben: Well I’ve got news. Jeremy had like…SO many more examples. And most of them are…not surprisingly…related to sex.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: The ear of corn. It rhymes with porn. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: The bowl of noodles gets used for sending nudes.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Some of this stuff is just silly… And sometimes it’s about getting around censorship on platforms or apps like TikTok. But it can also be about things that are more insidious.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: I think one big topic in the last few years has been the what the OK hand sign.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: The one with a thumb and index finger forming a circle meaning “All is well.” In 2017, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fknowyourmeme.com\u002Fmemes\u002Fok-symbol-%F0%9F%91%8C\"\u003Esome 4chan users\u003C\u002Fa\u003E created a hoax falsely claiming that the emoji had been co-opted by white supremacists. And then… it was. White supremacists really did co-opt the OK symbol.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: It evolved and became real. And then you have to make a decision along the way. If we are Emojipedia, do we say this does or doesn't mean white supremacy? And there's no good answer to that. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: No good answer because, as Jeremy sees it, if the *official encyclopedia of emoji* \u003Cem\u003Edoesn’t\u003C\u002Fem\u003E recognize sinister double-meanings, then it’s ignoring reality. … Like if the dictionary only defined “\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.merriam-webster.com\u002Fdictionary\u002Fswastika\"\u003Eswastika\u003C\u002Fa\u003E” as a religious icon. But if Emojipedia \u003Ci\u003Edoes\u003C\u002Fi\u003E, then it could legitimize how hate groups use emoji … and permanently ruin them for everybody else.","In the end, Jeremy did update the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Femojipedia.org\u002Fok-hand\u002F\"\u003Edefinition of the OK emoji\u003C\u002Fa\u003E and said it could be used as a symbol of white supremacy, “depending on context.”","Amory: Jeremy’s job as the founder of Emojipedia has landed him \u003Ci\u003Eanother\u003C\u002Fi\u003E job. As a voting member of the Unicode Consortium, the group of tech companies and organizations that decide which emoji get added…and which get changed.","\u003Cb\u003EBen: Can you go back to the beginning like the Big Bang of emoji?\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: Uh, if you cast your mind back to the late 90s, we didn't have smartphones. They were all basic feature phones. Most of them were black and white. And this is the same in Japan. But they realized that, hey, we could send a bit more information. And they were mostly used the original emoji sets we're talking 1997 through 1999 here. The first one we could find is a heart, and then it evolved to be things like clocks for timetables and weather icons.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: Over time these emoji have grown as a set of characters. And they’ve conveyed even more meaning and emotion. The Unicode Consortium by the way was founded even before emoji were invented…back in 1991. And in my opinion, the Unicode consortium has had a \u003Ci\u003Emassive\u003C\u002Fi\u003E impact on how we communicate. Because its work, really, is to standardize characters in software on computers everywhere. So that around the globe, we can communicate–no matter who we are, where we are, and what language we speak. Emoji are a part of this slow global standardization of computerized communication. Which is relevant when you realize that, even still, eggplant isn’t actually what someone means when they use the eggplant emoji.","Amory: Sooooo, back to the dinosaur fight, which may have been particularly poignant because Unicode has always struggled with emoji that suggest gender identity.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: It's been a big issue where a lot of the original emojis were men. If they had jobs and then the ones that didn't do anything meaningful, that sort of had, they were doing gestures, were mostly women. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: I.E. Police-MAN.

Where, for instance, there was a princess but no prince. So that was sort of a binary added where if there was a woman, you'd get a man. And if there was a man, there was a woman. But we were left with this position where you couldn't just say, I'm going to the doctor and send an emoji of a doctor you had to pick. Is it a woman doctor or a man doctor? Which it was well-intentioned, I think. But it ended up with us having to say, well, what is the gender of everyone with an emoji? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Unicode added a gender-neutral, \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Femojipedia.org\u002Fneutral\u002F\"\u003Egender non-conforming person\u003C\u002Fa\u003E to its emoji set in 2017. That was the same year that Unicode received its first \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.unicode.org\u002FL2\u002FL2019\u002F19080-transgender-flag.pdf\"\u003Eproposal for a transgender flag emoji\u003C\u002Fa\u003E.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: There was a petition about the fact that the lobster emoji had been approved and why was there no trans flag emoji as in sort of implying that, you know, why should lobsters get their own emoji when transgender people can't get their own emoji? \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: There were a handful of proposals for the transgender flag, actually. One was finally added in 2020. Bisexuality, asexuality, and lesbian flags have yet to appear. But while Unicode can add or change an emoji … it can’t tell people how to use it.","Ben: Back in October, Queer Twitter \u003Ci\u003Erefused\u003C\u002Fi\u003E to let dinos go the way of the OK hand sign. Almost immediately, the community bombarded TERFs with takedowns and messages of trans pride.","Amory: One tweet seemed to bring this fight out of its bubble. It came from a pro-trans cis woman named Courtney Milan. She’s a romance writer. But she also dabbles in creating emoji. And in a blow to the TERF community, she \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fcourtneymilan\u002Fstatus\u002F1450166274714062851?lang=en\"\u003Etweeted\u003C\u002Fa\u003E a simple message:","“These emoji dinosaurs ?? are both trans, I know this because I wrote the proposal to the Unicode Technical Committee asking for them.”","Ben: The Unicode Consortium doesn’t simply make emoji.

It’s a very official process.","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: they are technical documents and they are trying to make the case for an emoji, but there's often little over-emphatic language, often used about why it's essential this emoji be added and what the real thing is.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Courtney Milan \u003Ca href=\"http:\u002F\u002Funicode.org\u002FL2\u002FL2016\u002F16072-jurassic-emoji.pdf\"\u003Eproposed\u003C\u002Fa\u003E the first *set* of dinosaur emoji back in 2016. A T. rex, a brontosaurus, and a triceratops. Her proposal is eight pages long, with charts showing how often people search for dinosaur emoji online. Or how many books are about dinosaurs. (There are about 500 identified as “Dinosaur Erotica.”) It includes potential meanings for the emoji … including, interestingly, someone who has “failed to adapt to the times.”","Ben: Courtney was arguing that because she created these dinosaurs, she determined their gender. And she determined that they were transgender.","Does Courtney’s original proposal say the dinos are, in fact, trans?","\u003Cb\u003EJeremy: No, I didn't see anything in the proposal, that really makes that case. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: But that doesn’t mean the person proposing can’t declare they are. We’ve tried to ask Courtney about this. She hasn’t agreed to talk to us yet. Riley, for her part…wants us to remember that whatever we may think about the gender or sex of dinosaur emoji on Twitter…we should remember that the millions and millions of years of evolution in \u003Ci\u003Ebiological\u003C\u002Fi\u003E nature on planet Earth…tells a story that is a little more nuanced.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: So we don't know what determines the biological sex of non-avian dinosaurs as in like Triceratops and T. Rex, the ones that we love that went extinct 66 million years ago. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen: Right. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: Because we don't have the genetics, so we don't know whether it was genetically determined or today, for example, some of their closest living relatives, like alligators and crocodiles, have temperature-dependent sex determination, so the temperature of the nest determines whether more males or females are going to be born. There are some birds that might have hormonal shifts during their life that make them present and behave differently. And the relevance there is that tells us that what we think of as biological sex isn't binary, and it's much more malleable than we ever really understood. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: In other words, in Earth’s larger history, non-binary is way more common than people think.","Ben: Speaking of which, one of the sickest burns made in the Twitter battle, pointed out something else the TERFS should maybe remember when they post their dinosaur emoji.","\u003Cb\u003EAmory: This is the Jurassic Park plot point that I have to say. I completely forgot about that. Yeah, I don't even remember. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen: It's so awesome, though it's it is. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EAmory: It is, but I don't. I don't. I don't remember the discussion of the dinosaurs changing sex.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003EBen: Well, if you don't remember, Amory, hold on to your butts.\u003C\u002Fb\u003E","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: Oh. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Ben: The people who open Jurassic Park, in an effort to prevent the breeding of the dinosaurs…make all of the dinosaurs female.","But in their DNA cocktail when they’re genetically engineering the dinos…they splice in some Frog DNA. And some frog species, well … they can spontaneously change sex.","\u003Cb\u003ERiley: Even though it might be a little bit annoying sometimes to have people relate the transgender experience to animals that just happened to switch sexes for whatever reason. You know, we do joke around that like those are trans dinosaurs. That's a major plot point of that movie is that they change sex and wreak havoc. And the sense that, you know, we're this trans menace in this current political moment where all this attention is being put on us and we're treated with so much distrust and sort of suspicion that it's a way to jokingly lean into that. I think a little bit and say, OK, like if you think I'm basically a monster, I might as well be, you know, a toothy monster and run amok in some degree and the few bits of sort of representation that that we got become very dear to us. \u003C\u002Fb\u003E","Amory: Unlike so many other failed attempts to save a symbol, the push \u003Cem\u003Eagainst\u003C\u002Fem\u003E anti-trans use of the dinosaur emoji…it seems to have worked.","Ben: Some TERFs still have dinosaurs in their profile, sure. But there are so many other people pairing the dinos with messages of pride … or just using them in the most literal sense.

Jackson receive some long-delayed recognition from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for their formidable bodies of work, don't bother watching on Sunday night. (May is only one of the single funniest human beings ever to draw breath. If she’s going to give a speech why would anybody want to put it on television?) Additionally, this year, eight of the 23 competitive Oscar categories have been banished to an hour before airtime, to be distributed during red carpet festivities, with selected highlights from acceptance speeches edited into the broadcast later in the evening.","\u003Cspan data-index=\"2\" data-type=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","This decision has been widely and wisely condemned.

The contempt for craft categories is nothing new &mdash; a particularly rancid routine a couple of years ago had Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell pretending not to know what cinematographers do &mdash; and the asinine idea of demoting “lesser” awards to the pre-show was proposed back in 2019, but walked back after outcry from the Academy membership and in the press. (I cringe to recall one ceremony years ago during which winners for less sexy categories like documentaries and short subjects were forced to accept from a makeshift podium in the auditorium aisle, prompting host Chris Rock to kid that next year anyone who isn’t famous enough will have to pick up their award in the parking lot.)","\u003Cspan data-index=\"3\" data-type=\"youtube\"\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E","The prevailing wisdom within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences seems to be that regular folks don’t care about these categories &mdash; because I guess boring stuff like editing, production design, original score and sound aren’t important aspects of the cinematic experience &mdash; and audiences will instead be indulged this year with new awards sourced on Twitter, of all godforsaken places, for #OscarsFanFavorite and #OscarsCheerMoment. (Fans can vote up to 20 times a day for their favorites, which given the sometimes sinister and subversive ways in which the internet works makes me really wish “Cats” had come out last year.) Instead of turning the Oscars into the People’s Choice Awards, maybe the Academy could try explaining to us civilians why we \u003Cem\u003Eshould\u003C\u002Fem\u003E care about craft categories and all the skilled labor that goes into making movies? At least that’s what they used to do.","See, I grew up watching the Oscars, loving all the gaudy pageantry, production numbers and a show that some nights seemed like it was never going to end. But more importantly, it provided me with a sense of who these people were making the pictures I went to see and an understanding of what they did behind the scenes. The Academy Awards were a tantalizing glimpse behind the curtain for a movie-mad kid, and all the clips and montages &mdash; and yes, especially those lifetime achievement awards &mdash; gave me an understanding that art exists in a continuity, building upon and paying tribute to what has come before. The telecast was the industry’s advertisement for itself, an almost four-hour product reel arguing for why movies mattered.","The Academy doesn’t seem to feel like making much of a case for that anymore. Last year’s desultory distribution of statuettes didn’t even bother showing clips from the nominated films. It was one of the most joyless spectacles I’ve ever seen on TV, a \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.wbur.org\u002Fnews\u002F2021\u002F04\u002F23\u002Facademy-awards-oscars-commentary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003Etasteless gathering\u003C\u002Fa\u003E during those pre-vaccine days, for which the producers kicked all the homeless people out of LA’s Union Station to give an award to a Disney movie about homelessness made by a billionaire Marvel director.

There’s a perception that the Academy is out of touch with what appeals to mass audiences but I think it's more a matter of terrible priorities. After all, here we have a universally beloved performer whose films have collectively grossed more at the box office than any other actor, yet for some insane reason Samuel L. Jackson will be accepting his award off the air? (It’s the kind of programming decision that makes one want to say the kind of words you usually hear Samuel L.
