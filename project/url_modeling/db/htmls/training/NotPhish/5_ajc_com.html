Prabhu joined The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2017 to cover Georgia government and politics. Her reporting focuses on gambling and abortion legislation, criminal justice and social issues and legislative races. Born in Queens, N.Y., and raised in northern Virginia, Maya received her bachelor’s degree from Spelman College before heading back to the D.C. area to get a master’s from the University of Maryland. Maya previously reported for The Post and Courier in Charleston, S.C., where she also covered state government and politics. Before that, Maya wrote for newspapers and online news organizations in South Carolina and Maryland. After many years away, she was excited to make her way back to Atlanta.

Ben is interested in how governments work and the people/structures that make governments fail. Covering Fulton County government means Ben is a watchdog for one out of every 10 Georgians' local tax dollars. Drop a line because Ben could use your help making sense of this confusing world, but without your help will default to seeking context and eating too many boiled peanuts.

Christopher Escobar, 35, purchased the Plaza in 2017 and recently signed a 25-year lease with Asana Partners, who bought the Plaza on Ponce shopping center five years ago. Despite the societal challenges working against him - the rise of streaming, the pandemic, fancy multiplexes - he sees a pathway to make the Plaza even more of a neighborhood magnet, a community hub, a gathering spot. And he has big plans. Rodney Ho spoke with Escobar about those plans and the future of the Plaza Theatre for this week’s podcast.Find it at <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/podcasts/\">ajc.com/podcasts</a> and at the Apple Podcast store."},{"_id":"HWGFPSEHZZCIFPF67PQJ6RYGDI","additional_properties":{"inline_comments":[],"comments":[],"_id":1647522423992},"type":"text","content":"Listen to accessAtlanta now or open in <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/accessatlanta-things-to-do-in-atlanta/id1352003537?mt=2#\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/music\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/accessatlanta-things-to-do-in-atlanta\">Stitcher,</a> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7pslV1ffJUFEfldInfwkNp\">Spotify,</a> or wherever you listen to podcasts.

I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have a delightfully adorable English bulldog named Goo Goo and a equally adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","org":"ajc","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","author_type":"Staff","firstName":"Rodney","books":[],"podcasts":[],"awards":[],"custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","_id":"rodney-ho","status":true}},"type":"author","version":"0.5.8","url":"/staff/rodney-ho/"}]},"headlines":{"basic":"Amy Schumer back on the road, coming to the Roxy Sept. 11"},"description":{"basic":"Amy Schumer is coming back to Atlanta, this time at the Roxy Theatre at the Battery on Sept. 11.

I have been covering radio since 2001 and TV since 2005. A New York native, I graduated Princeton University in 1991. I covered education at The Virginian-Pilot from 1991 to 1994, then moved to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1994 to cover finance. In 1995, I oversaw transportation, which included UPS and Delta Air Lines. In 1996, the Wall Street Journal hired me to be a small-business/entrepreneurship reporter until 2001. I returned to the AJC that year and wrote about nightlife, youth culture, radio and comedy. In 2005, I began covering TV and have since added film. I've had the honor to interview Oprah Winfrey, Tyler Perry, Steven Spielberg, Billy Crystal and even Gallagher. I've been blogging since 2004. I've also been the paper's \"American Idol\" expert since day one in 2002. I love tennis, pop culture, karaoke and seeing live events, be it concerts, plays or comedy shows. I have a delightfully adorable English bulldog named Goo Goo and a equally adorable adopted daughter named Vega.","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ajcradiotv","twitter":"https://twitter.com/ajcrodneyho","custom_ajc_phone":"404-526-5688","books":[],"podcasts":[],"education":[{"name":"Oyster Bay High School, 1987"},{"name":"Princeton University, B.A., political economics, 1991"},{"name":"George State University Robinson School, MBA marketig, 2007"}],"awards":[],"last_updated_date":"2021-03-30T12:51:24.297Z","image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/ajc/3701b49c-0a45-4a95-a5c8-7d7a96ec061f.png","expertise":"2, Film, TV, radio, comedy, things to do around town, business","beat":"Entertatinment","author_type":"Staff","type":"author","bio_page":"/staff/rodney-ho/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/rodneyhoajc/"}}}]},"subtype":"Blog","websites":{"ajc":{"website_section":{"_id":"/life/radiotvtalk-blog","_website":"ajc","type":"section","version":"0.6.0","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene Blog","description":"News about entertainers, music, movies and TV shows with Georgia ties, Atlanta TV and radio","path":"/life/radiotvtalk-blog","parent_id":"/life","parent":{"default":"/life"},"additional_properties":{"original":{"_id":"/life/radiotvtalk-blog","site":{"section_comments_enabled":"Yes","site_description":"News about entertainers, music, movies and TV shows with Georgia ties, Atlanta TV and radio","site_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene Blog"},"navigation":{"nav_title":"Georgia Entertainment Scene"},"_website":"ajc","name":"Georgia Entertainment Scene Blog","order":{"ComposerNav":1052,"default":2011,"SectionMap":1025,"MainMenuRedesign2021":2004,"AmpNav":2011},"parent":{"default":"/life","ComposerNav":"/","TopNav":null,"BottomNav":null,"TopNavRedesign":null,"SectionMap":"/","MainMenuRedesign2021":"/things-to-do","AmpNav":"/life"},"ancestors":{"TopNav":[],"default":["/","/life"],"TopNavRedesign":[],"SectionMap":["/"],"MainMenuRedesign2021":["/","/things-to-do"],"AmpNav":["/","/life"]},"inactive":false,"node_type":"section"}},"_website_section_id":"ajc./life/radiotvtalk-blog"},"website_url":"/life/radiotvtalk-blog/sugarlands-kristian-bush-releasing-52-songs-to-celebrate-52-years-on-earth/XS7VRP2TONCQHEZPWIJRK624UE/"}},"additional_properties":{},"publish_date":"2022-03-24T17:11:27.615Z","canonical_url":"/life/radiotvtalk-blog/sugarlands-kristian-bush-releasing-52-songs-to-celebrate-52-years-on-earth/XS7VRP2TONCQHEZPWIJRK624UE/","content_elements":[{"_id":"BWEMD6Y4PZEFXPGHWHFIROATJ4","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1594090779652,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"Atlanta’s own Kristian Bush, at age 52, feels like he’s been at an interesting musical juncture every decade."},{"_id":"NRCSWU54HRAPVEU5NX6K3APVMY","type":"text","additional_properties":{"_id":1648123012846,"comments":[],"inline_comments":[]},"content":"In 1992, at age 22, he signed a record deal with Atlantic with his roots-rock duo Billy Pilgrim.
