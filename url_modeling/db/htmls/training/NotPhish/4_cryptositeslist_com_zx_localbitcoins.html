  <h3 class="bold-heading">Welcome to LocalBitcoins.com</h3>
  <div>
    <p>      
      Please read through these Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy and our Privacy Policy (collectively as “Agreement”) carefully before you (“you”) start using the services. Privacy Policy includes our Cookie Policy.

Such modifications and revisions will be notified to you through the Service no later than thirty (30) days before they become effective.

Such modifications will be published on our site and notified to you without undue delay.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Registration and User Account</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      To use our Services, you must first register with us by creating a user account ("user account" or "account"). An account will only be issued once you have provided all necessary information required by us for registration and the information has been examined according to the applicable legal requirements placed upon us by the authorities. This examination and requirements include, but are not limited to, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism regulations as well as, in the case of company accounts, the examination of the details of your business, including the beneficial owners. All the information that we request you to provide in connection with the registration must be true, accurate and complete. If we believe that the information is not true, accurate or complete, we have the right to refuse your access to the site, or any of its resources, and to deny, terminate or suspend your Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      A person may only have one account at the time (except in the case of legal entities). You may not use the Services or create an account on behalf of someone other than yourself. You are not allowed to sell, borrow, share or otherwise make available your account or any detail necessary to access your account to ANYONE other than yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of your username, password, authentication code or any other code or credential that you use to access the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not provide any misleading or fraudulent information, including, but not limited to having a non-personal phone number. Creating fake reputation information for your account, faking your country of origin or providing fraudulent identification documents is prohibited and will lead to termination or suspension of your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have the right to delete your account and to terminate this Agreement at any time. You are responsible for all the obligations which have arisen up until the termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      By registering and using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations governing Money Service Businesses or Cryptoasset Businesses or Virtual Asset Service Providers or similar applicable regulation of the jurisdiction you are located in.
    </p>
    <h4>Company accounts</h4>
    <p>
      If you wish to use our Services as a legal entity, you are required to register an account in the name of that entity as the main account for that entity ("company account"). When creating a company account, you confirm that you are duly authorized and have the legal capacity to execute this Agreement and that this Agreement is legally binding on such entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      After registration of the main company account, one or more other company sub-accounts may be registered for the same legal entity so that the company account and each sub-account is registered in the name of and operated by separate natural persons on behalf of the entity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same legal entity may place several advertisements on our platform, created by different company account holders, but such advertisements may not be fully overlapping (e.g. using the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country).
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Identity Verification</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In order to ensure LocalBitcoins remains a safe platform for all of our users, and for us to comply with mandatory legal obligations which we are subjected to, we may require you to verify your identity to access the Services we offer. Identity verification may be required when you create advertisements, pass certain trade volume limits, during trade disputes, fraud investigations, and to ensure account ownership. As part of our ID verification process we require you to provide us with your full name as well as documents and photographs that verify your identity (e.g. valid passport).
    </p>
    <p>
      In certain situations (e.g. due to the regulatory or legal requirements) we may require enhanced identity verification. This may include requirements to verify details or sources of funds regarding payments you have made or received during trades on LocalBitcoins as well as bitcoin transactions that you have sent or received from your account.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Bitcoin Trading</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      You can place one or more advertisements on our platform when you wish to offer to buy or sell bitcoins. We have the right to restrict the number of your advertisements for security reasons and reasons of suspected misconduct or fraudulent activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bitcoin trades ("trade" or "contact") to either buy or sell bitcoins are initiated by responding with a trade request to advertisements created by other users. With the trade request you are making a legally binding offer and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the trade (such as exchange rate, bitcoin amount and terms of payment) as determined by the advertiser to whom you are sending the trade request to. When sending the trade request, you may need to select from options made available in the advertisements or accept any freeform terms and conditions set out by the advertiser in the Terms of trade field and displayed on the advertisement page. The terms and conditions of the trade must be in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In case of discrepancy, the terms of this Agreement will have precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are selling bitcoin it is your responsibility to check that you have received payment for the full amount, that the payment is not made by a third party to the trade without that party’s authorisation, and that it was made according to your instructions given to the buyer. After you have released a trade to the buyer it is not possible to cancel, reverse, dispute or otherwise recover or return the bitcoins to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payments made by buyers must be sent by the same person or entity who is the holder of the account or the company account unless authorised in writing by the payeer. Receiving, making, providing, or attempting to receive, make or provide payments to or from third parties is forbidden and considered a violation of this Agreement unless authorised by the third party.
    </p>
    <p>
      All communication relevant to the trade must happen in the trade chat on our platform in such a way that it is readily available for LocalBitcoins support staff to review. Consequently, communications on our platform are not considered private communications between you and other users, but LocalBitcoins is also a party to such communications, and may access and otherwise process such communications in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication that has not occurred on our platform or that has been hidden, encrypted or otherwise obstructed from view is not taken into consideration during dispute review and dispute resolution.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Disputing Bitcoin Trades</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      When a buyer and a seller are in disagreement over a trade, either party or LocalBitcoins can start a dispute ("disputed trade” or "dispute") to initiate a mediation process on the bitcoin held in escrow. Disputed trades are reviewed and resolved by LocalBitcoins support staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disputes can only be started on trades that are open and marked as paid by the buyer but not yet released by the seller. Trades that are not marked as paid by the buyer, have been released by the seller, or already disputed and resolved are considered completed and cannot be disputed, reversed, or altered. LocalBitcoins support has the right to re-open trades when the payment has been made but the trade has been cancelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      LocalBitcoins does not become a guarantor of any party’s performance of a trade. Therefore, although LocalBitcoins helps in resolving disputes, you assume the risk that any party with whom you trade ( “counterparty”) fails to perform in accordance with your agreement with the counterparty. By using LocalBitcoins’ Services, you release LocalBitcoins from any liability arising out of or related to a counterparty’s failure to perform as agreed.
    </p>
    <h4>Unresponsiveness</h4>
    <p>
      When you have placed advertisements which have not expired or you are involved in a bitcoin trade, it is important that you remain active and available at least until the trade is completed, canceled, or resolved. This means that you must be able to provide a response to a request by LocalBitcoins support in a disputed trade within twenty-four (24) hours or you may be deemed as unresponsive and the dispute may be resolved against you for this reason alone.
    </p>
    <h4>Dispute review</h4>
    <p>
      During a dispute review LocalBitcoins support may give you instructions that you are required to follow. The instructions given to you may require you to provide proof of payment, proof that you have or have not received payment (e.g. bank transaction history), additional ID verification, photo; audio; or video evidence, or any other documents deemed relevant by LocalBitcoins. Failure to follow the instructions may lead to the dispute being resolved against you.
    </p>
    <h4>Dispute resolution criteria</h4>
    <p>
      A disputed trade is most commonly resolved by LocalBitcoins support moving the escrowed bitcoin to the buyer or the seller of the disputed trade once the dispute resolution criteria are met.
    </p>
    <p>
      In rare situations where neither party fulfills the criteria, or it is in other ways unclear or not possible to determine which party has fulfilled the dispute resolution criteria, LocalBitcoins may decide to resolve the dispute by splitting the escrowed bitcoin between the buyer and the seller evenly or unevenly.
    </p>
    <h4>Dispute resolution criteria</h4>
    <p>
      LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin buyer when one of the following criteria are met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The buyer has made the payment according to the instructions provided by the seller in the trade chat, advertisement terms of trade, or advertisement payment details and the buyer has provided sufficient proof that the payment was made according to these instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The seller has become unresponsive.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      LocalBitcoins can resolve a disputed trade in the favor of a bitcoin seller when one of the following criteria are met:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The buyer has not provided payment or not provided payment in full
      </li>
      <li>
        The payment made by the buyer has been held/frozen/stopped by the payment provider
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        The buyer is not responding.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Advertisements</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      You can create bitcoin trade advertisements ("advertisement" or "ad" or "ads") to advertise that you want to buy or sell bitcoins. Other users can send trade requests to you from the advertisements that you’ve created. When a trade request is sent to you a bitcoin trade is automatically started.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advertisements for buying with or selling against cash are not allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have advertisements enabled you are required to be active and available to reply to trades started from these advertisements. If a dispute is initiated in a trade against an advertiser who is not active and available, the advertiser may be deemed unresponsive within the meaning of this Agreement and the dispute may be resolved against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Information and payment details you provide in advertisements and trades must at all times be correct and up to date. Disputes may be resolved against you if you include out-of-date payment details and a buyer completes payment accordingly. Refusal to complete trades or to provide payment details for trades opened from your advertisements is considered a violation of this agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement details must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the buyer to pay. After initiation of a trade the price is locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without consent from both parties of the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple advertisements which are fully overlapping (e.g. using the same trade limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country) are not allowed.
    </p>

Account suspension results in a temporary loss of access to most parts of our Services. Account termination results in permanent loss of access to all Services.
    </p>
    <p>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Limiting Access to Your LocalBitcoins Wallet</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In certain situations your ability to access, conduct bitcoin transactions, or start trades using bitcoin held in your LocalBitcoins wallet may be limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      This limitation may be applied specifically to your account in order to safeguard bitcoin stored in your wallet when we e.g. suspect a third party has gained unauthorized access to your account; if we suspect you of engaging in or being involved in fraudulent or illegal activity; if we are provided with valid legal request from an authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      This limitation may be applied generally to all users or a subset of our users during service outages or maintenance outages of the website; during bitcoin hardforks or other situations where we believe there is a high risk to your bitcoin balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that we limit access to your wallet we aim to remove the limitation as soon as possible once the reasons for the suspension or termination no longer exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will give you a notice of any limitation of access to your wallet but we may, if it is reasonable to do so (for example we consider it advisable for security reasons), limit access to your wallet without prior notice.
    </p>
    <p>

  <h3 class="bold-heading">Supporting Blockchain Forks and Other Cryptocurrencies
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      From time to time, new and alternative cryptocurrencies and/or forks of the bitcoin blockchain may be created. This may result in holders of private keys containing a bitcoin balance receiving a corresponding amount of the new cryptocurrency on the newly created blockchain (“air-drop”). We reserve the right at our sole discretion to decide if and how we support any new cryptocurrencies and/or blockchain forks in our Services including defining which blockchain shall be deemed as bitcoin within the meaning of this Agreement. We strive to communicate our decisions concerning any significant new forks or cryptocurrencies on our website in a timely manner. If we decide to not support a new cryptocurrency we may, but are not obligated to, compensate users who held bitcoin in their LocalBitcoins account at the time of the air-drop in a manner deemed appropriate by us. We reserve the right to provide compensation by converting all of the available new cryptocurrency to bitcoin and sharing all of the converted bitcoin between users who held a bitcoin balance on their account at the time of the creation of the new cryptocurrency. In case such a conversion takes place we may charge you a reasonable processing fee (which shall not exceed the amount of compensation payable to you).
    </p>
    <p>
      If we decide to support a new cryptocurrency, unless otherwise communicated by us, this Agreement, including any reference to bitcoin, shall be equally applied to the new cryptocurrency.

We have described all those service providers above in Section 4. Where such service providers are not established in a country ensuring an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, such as the United States, the transfers will be covered by the standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by another appropriate safeguard mechanism such as the Privacy Shield Framework.

  <h3 class="bold-heading">7. Your Rights</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      7.1. In this Section 7, we have summarised the principal rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, might contain restrictions depending on the legal basis for processing the data and, to keep this policy as concise and easily accessible as possible, not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for further details of these rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2. Your principal rights under the data protection law are:
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">

    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, to access the personal data. Providing that the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee. You can view and export your personal data under your account settings page.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (b)    the right to rectification;
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed. You can correct or update some of your personal data yourself through your user account.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (c)    the right to erasure;
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      You have the right to the erasure of your personal data. We have described our policy for retaining and deleting personal data above in Section 6.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (d)    the right to object to processing;
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is not that the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or for the purposes of the legal obligations arising from the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws or due to legitimate interests of ours and/or those of third-parties. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (e)    the right to data portability;
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is consent or contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (f)    the right to complain to a supervisory authority;
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:10px;">
      (g)    the right to withdraw consent.
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left:25px;">
      To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.3. Without prejudice to the aforementioned, if we have reasonable doubts concerning the identity of a user exercising his/her rights referred to in Section 7.2 or if we otherwise deem it necessary due to security reasons, we may request the provision of additional information and otherwise use all reasonable measures necessary to confirm the identity of the user.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.4. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by contacting our customer support. Concerning "Right to erasure" users are also able to request the deletion of their account through our site. Further, you can also remove some of your personal data yourself through your user account.
