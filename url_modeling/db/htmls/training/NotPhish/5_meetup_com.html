After he lost, Trump told his followers that it had, in fact, been stolen, and said that if they didn’t fight like hell they wouldn’t have a country anymore.\n\n3. Trump filed 60 lawsuits claiming election fraud, and lost all 60. After that, he must have understood that the election was not stolen.\n\n4. Trump organized thousands on January 6, 2021 in front of the Capitol building, and ordered them to march on the building.\n\n5. He knew that for them to stand outside of that building and yell would do nothing to stop or delay Biden’s certification. That is why he must have expected them to violently attack the Capitol building.\n\n6. Through those actions Trump clearly attempted to overthrow the U.S. government by force.

The typefaces, fonts, and text styling used can have a significant impact on the user experience — and there are few accessibility guidelines that relate to text accessibility. This session will provide an overview of how reading is processed in the human mind, and how to minimize the cognitive effort and maximize the visual accessibility of online text.\n\nFor most people, the human mind is incredibly adept at reading text. Once sufficient reading skills are achieved the brain can quickly form mental models for texts. This allows us to avoid the visual parsing of distinct letters and even words, so we instead quickly process blocks of character and word shapes and patterns almost instantaneously into meaning.\n\nTypography, font, and text styling choices can significantly impact this, thus slowing reading speed, interfering with text-to-meaning conversions, and increasing cognitive processing that could otherwise be utilized by the reader. This presentation will help participants understand the reading processes, and provide distinct recommendations and suggestions for optimal typography and text presentation.\n\nAnd there will be time for your questions.\n\nPRESENTER BIO\nJared Smith is the Associate Director of WebAIM. He is a highly demanded presenter and trainer and has provided web accessibility training to tens of thousands of web professionals throughout the world.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience working in the web design, development, and accessibility field, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that is used to help others create and maintain highly accessible web content. Much of his written work, including a broad range of tutorials, articles, and other materials, is featured at WebAIM.org.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\nThe presentation will have Captions [CC].\n\nLIVESTREAM\nProvided by Internet Society Accessibility SIG.\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/K6l6FwMChvI\n\nACCREDITATION\nAll A11yNYC meetups are pre-approved for IAAP Continuing Accessibility Education Credits (CAEC).\n\nSPONSORS\nThanks to Adobe, Equal Entry, Fable, and Google for sponsoring.","startDate":"2022-04-05T23:30:00.000Z","endDate":"2022-04-06T00:30:00.000Z","eventStatus":"https://schema.org/EventScheduled","image":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","eventAttendanceMode":"https://schema.org/OnlineEventAttendanceMode","location":{"@type":"VirtualLocation","url":"https://www.meetup.com/A11yNYC/events/284234182"},"organizer":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A11yNYC - Accessibility New York City","url":"https://www.meetup.com/A11yNYC"},"performer":"A11yNYC - Accessibility New York City"},{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"Jupiter & Neptune In Pisces with Astrologer Jessica Adams","url":"https://www.meetup.com/Astrology-and-Tarot-America/events/282337898","description":"What happens when Jupiter - the planet of opportunity, optimism, hope, expansion and growth - lines up exactly with Neptune - the planet of escapism, holidays from reality and alternative worlds?\n\nApril 9th-17th 2022 is very special, thanks to the rare Jupiter-Neptune conjunction and will light up an area of your horoscope in a life-changing way.\n\nJoin Jessica Adams & special guests for this free online event to learn more.\n\nPlease note: Places at this 'Jupiter & Neptune In Pisces with Astrologer Jessica Adams' Zoom are limited.

Join us every last Monday of the month from 6:30-8:00pm EST on Zoom, to connect with other folks who have left insular religious communities to discuss topics like relationships with family and friends, mental health, and lots more. You don’t have to have attended previously to join this one!

Trump filed 60 lawsuits claiming election fraud, and lost all 60. After that, he must have understood that the election was not stolen.\n\n4. Trump organized thousands on January 6, 2021 in front of the Capitol building, and ordered them to march on the building.\n\n5.

The typefaces, fonts, and text styling used can have a significant impact on the user experience — and there are few accessibility guidelines that relate to text accessibility. This session will provide an overview of how reading is processed in the human mind, and how to minimize the cognitive effort and maximize the visual accessibility of online text.\n\nFor most people, the human mind is incredibly adept at reading text. Once sufficient reading skills are achieved the brain can quickly form mental models for texts. This allows us to avoid the visual parsing of distinct letters and even words, so we instead quickly process blocks of character and word shapes and patterns almost instantaneously into meaning.\n\nTypography, font, and text styling choices can significantly impact this, thus slowing reading speed, interfering with text-to-meaning conversions, and increasing cognitive processing that could otherwise be utilized by the reader. This presentation will help participants understand the reading processes, and provide distinct recommendations and suggestions for optimal typography and text presentation.\n\nAnd there will be time for your questions.\n\nPRESENTER BIO\nJared Smith is the Associate Director of WebAIM. He is a highly demanded presenter and trainer and has provided web accessibility training to tens of thousands of web professionals throughout the world.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience working in the web design, development, and accessibility field, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that is used to help others create and maintain highly accessible web content.

We will discuss and encourage sharing of our experiences, talk about trauma bonding and how to break the cycle. Most importantly, we will share our communal experience and provide support by listening and sharing our what we've gone through so that all attendees know that they are not alone.\n\nPlease read this message carefully: Before signing up to any meeting in this group, you MUST attend a First Timers Meeting event. There are NO exceptions to this. These meetings are designed to ensure community safety and if you sign up for an Established Member event without attending one, you will be removed from that event. Before you do anything else, including signing up for an Established Members group, check out our \"Events\" section and sign up for a First Timers Group and attend one BEFORE you sign up for an Established Member meeting. We are very strict about this rule, so please do so as we hate to remove people from meetings and have to send a PM advising someone of this rule.\n\nAll meetings are run through Zoom. The links and passwords are reset every day. The links are all sent the morning of the meetings. You will receive your link through whatever email you use through Meetup. Please ensure you have your settings with Meetup set to receive emails as they will come in through that email. If you sign up for a meeting, please check you have received your link well before the meeting as we do not check our emails during meetings. It is your responsibility to check that you have received your link - if you haven't received it and it's before meeting time, simply send your organizer (Kay R., Paige, Roby or Anthony) a PM and we will ensure you receive it.\n\nSome more general rules that will be reviewed in your First Timer's Meeting:\n\nDO NOT private message moderators/organizers unless you have a question regarding the group as a whole, or you didn't receive a link to the meeting. DO NOT message us for medical, legal, or general advice, and do not contact us to vent. We understand that times are tough and this is not an easy situation to deal with, but we are all running this group on a volunteer basis, and we do not have any medical or counseling degrees. If there is an emergency please call 911, contact your local police, hospital, or physician. There is also a domestic violence hotline (800.799.SAFE) and a suicide hotline (800-273-8255) - these are free 24 hour services. We appreciate your understanding in advance.\nDO NOT private message other members of the group. Again, this is an exception to the rule above, but if you see someone in a meeting you'd like to reach out to, please send the organizer of that meeting a message and we will ask that person if they consent to being contacted and will pass on your info to them. If a member tells you during a meeting to reach out to them, that is OK as they have consented already. This is for the safety of our members, which we take very seriously.\n\nWe are happy you are here and hope you find this a supportive community. All of the rules are above are to ensure that you are safe and that the people you will be interacting with are validating, here for the 'right reasons', and are properly vetted. We look forward to meeting you!\n\nx\n\nKay R.","city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","isPrivate":false,"isNewGroup":false,"groupPhoto":{"__typename":"Image","id":"501046756","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","preview":null},"stats":{"__typename":"GroupStats","memberCounts":{"__typename":"GroupMemberCounts","all":342}}},"recommendationSource":"popular_groups_nearby","recommendationId":"1caf39a8-0aa1-4605-8f64-5028474a7a0f"},{"__typename":"RankedGroupsResultEdge","node":{"__typename":"Group","upcomingEvents":{"__typename":"RootEventsConnection","count":1,"edges":[{"__typename":"RootEventsEdge","cursor":"MjAyMi0wMy0yNlQyMzowMFo=","node":{"__typename":"Event","id":"284275880!chp","title":"March Meetup Super Party (6 Meetup Groups)","eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/afterwork/events/284275880","dateTime":"2022-03-26T19:00-04:00","isSaved":false,"timezone":"US/Eastern","isAttending":false,"venue":{"__typename":"Venue","address":"110 Delancey St","city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us"},"isOnline":false,"going":226,"maxTickets":20,"tickets":{"__typename":"EventTicketsConnection","count":226,"edges":[{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__typename":"Ticket","id":"1908068052!chp","user":{"__typename":"User","id":"422127!chp","memberPhoto":{"__typename":"Image","id":"297296062","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null}}}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__typename":"Ticket","id":"1906230473!chp","user":{"__typename":"User","id":"3166700!chp","memberPhoto":{"__typename":"Image","id":"251764188","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null}}}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__typename":"Ticket","id":"1907902689!chp","user":{"__typename":"User","id":"5129754!chp","memberPhoto":{"__typename":"Image","id":"308592182","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null}}}}]}}}]},"id":"34766392","name":"Frankie G's Afterwork NYC Meetup","link":"https://www.meetup.com/afterwork","description":"Heys!

Based in New York, Footsteps provides a range of services, including social and emotional support, educational and career guidance, workshops and social activities, and access to resources. Thanks to Footsteps, former ultra-Orthodox Jews have a safe, supportive, and flourishing community to turn to as they work to define their own identities, build new connections, and lead productive lives on their own terms.","duration":"PT1H30M","timezone":"US/Eastern","eventType":"online","currency":"USD","images":[{"__ref":"Image:501959254"}],"venue":{"__ref":"Venue:26906060"},"onlineVenue":{"__typename":"OnlineVenue","type":"zoom","url":null},"isSaved":false,"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/interfaithless-meetup-group/events/284255669","group":{"__ref":"Group:36145828"},"going":24,"maxTickets":0,"tickets({\"input\":{\"first\":3}})":{"__typename":"EventTicketsConnection","count":24,"edges":[{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1905943516!chp"}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1905882693!chp"}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1905741817!chp"}}]},"isAttending":false,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN"},"Image:502607790":{"id":"502607790","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","preview":null},"Image:502607734":{"id":"502607734","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","preview":null},"Group:36207202":{"id":"36207202","__typename":"Group","slug":"web3cryptoprojects-NYC","isPrivate":false,"isOrganizer":false,"isNewGroup":true,"name":"web3CryptoProjects -

The typefaces, fonts, and text styling used can have a significant impact on the user experience — and there are few accessibility guidelines that relate to text accessibility. This session will provide an overview of how reading is processed in the human mind, and how to minimize the cognitive effort and maximize the visual accessibility of online text.\n\nFor most people, the human mind is incredibly adept at reading text. Once sufficient reading skills are achieved the brain can quickly form mental models for texts. This allows us to avoid the visual parsing of distinct letters and even words, so we instead quickly process blocks of character and word shapes and patterns almost instantaneously into meaning.\n\nTypography, font, and text styling choices can significantly impact this, thus slowing reading speed, interfering with text-to-meaning conversions, and increasing cognitive processing that could otherwise be utilized by the reader. This presentation will help participants understand the reading processes, and provide distinct recommendations and suggestions for optimal typography and text presentation.\n\nAnd there will be time for your questions.\n\nPRESENTER BIO\nJared Smith is the Associate Director of WebAIM. He is a highly demanded presenter and trainer and has provided web accessibility training to tens of thousands of web professionals throughout the world.\n\nWith over 20 years of experience working in the web design, development, and accessibility field, he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that is used to help others create and maintain highly accessible web content. Much of his written work, including a broad range of tutorials, articles, and other materials, is featured at WebAIM.org.\n\nACCESSIBILITY\nThe presentation will have Captions [CC].\n\nLIVESTREAM\nProvided by Internet Society Accessibility SIG.\n\nLink: https://youtu.be/K6l6FwMChvI\n\nACCREDITATION\nAll A11yNYC meetups are pre-approved for IAAP Continuing Accessibility Education Credits (CAEC).\n\nSPONSORS\nThanks to Adobe, Equal Entry, Fable, and Google for sponsoring.","duration":"PT1H","timezone":"US/Eastern","eventType":"online","currency":"USD","images":[{"__ref":"Image:502263737"}],"venue":{"__ref":"Venue:26906060"},"onlineVenue":{"__typename":"OnlineVenue","type":"zoom","url":null},"isSaved":false,"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/A11yNYC/events/284234182","group":{"__ref":"Group:11913282"},"going":214,"maxTickets":0,"tickets({\"input\":{\"first\":3}})":{"__typename":"EventTicketsConnection","count":214,"edges":[{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1905354544!chp"}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1908068766!chp"}},{"__typename":"EventTicketsEdge","node":{"__ref":"Ticket:1906770570!chp"}}]},"isAttending":false,"rsvpState":"JOIN_OPEN"},"Image:500467905":{"id":"500467905","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","preview":null},"Image:494684905":{"id":"494684905","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-events/","preview":null},"Group:33669060":{"id":"33669060","__typename":"Group","slug":"Astrology-and-Tarot-America","isPrivate":false,"isOrganizer":false,"isNewGroup":false,"name":"Astrology and Tarot America","urlname":"Astrology-and-Tarot-America","timezone":"America/New_York","link":"https://www.meetup.com/Astrology-and-Tarot-America","city":"New York","state":"NY","country":"us","groupPhoto":{"__ref":"Image:494684905"}},"Image:301347923":{"id":"301347923","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null},"User:1877426!chp":{"id":"1877426!chp","__typename":"User","memberPhoto":{"__ref":"Image:301347923"}},"Ticket:1895567063!chp":{"id":"1895567063!chp","__typename":"Ticket","user":{"__ref":"User:1877426!chp"}},"Image:1019354":{"id":"1019354","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null},"User:3202036!chp":{"id":"3202036!chp","__typename":"User","memberPhoto":{"__ref":"Image:1019354"}},"Ticket:1897419923!chp":{"id":"1897419923!chp","__typename":"Ticket","user":{"__ref":"User:3202036!chp"}},"Image:251549101":{"id":"251549101","__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://secure-content.meetupstatic.com/images/classic-member/","preview":null},"User:6127960!chp":{"id":"6127960!chp","__typename":"User","memberPhoto":{"__ref":"Image:251549101"}},"Ticket:1897424213!chp":{"id":"1897424213!chp","__typename":"Ticket","user":{"__ref":"User:6127960!chp"}},"Event:282337898!chp":{"id":"282337898!chp","__typename":"Event","title":"Jupiter \u0026 Neptune In Pisces with Astrologer Jessica Adams","dateTime":"2022-04-08T17:00-04:00","endTime":"2022-04-08T18:30-04:00","description":"What happens when Jupiter - the planet of opportunity, optimism, hope, expansion and growth - lines up exactly with Neptune - the planet of escapism, holidays from reality and alternative worlds?\n\nApril 9th-17th 2022 is very special, thanks to the rare Jupiter-Neptune conjunction and will light up an area of your horoscope in a life-changing way.\n\nJoin Jessica Adams \u0026 special guests for this free online event to learn more.\n\nPlease note: Places at this 'Jupiter \u0026 Neptune In Pisces with Astrologer Jessica Adams' Zoom are limited.

We will discuss and encourage sharing of our experiences, talk about trauma bonding and how to break the cycle. Most importantly, we will share our communal experience and provide support by listening and sharing our what we've gone through so that all attendees know that they are not alone.\n\nPlease read this message carefully: Before signing up to any meeting in this group, you MUST attend a First Timers Meeting event. There are NO exceptions to this. These meetings are designed to ensure community safety and if you sign up for an Established Member event without attending one, you will be removed from that event. Before you do anything else, including signing up for an Established Members group, check out our \"Events\" section and sign up for a First Timers Group and attend one BEFORE you sign up for an Established Member meeting. We are very strict about this rule, so please do so as we hate to remove people from meetings and have to send a PM advising someone of this rule.\n\nAll meetings are run through Zoom. The links and passwords are reset every day. The links are all sent the morning of the meetings. You will receive your link through whatever email you use through Meetup. Please ensure you have your settings with Meetup set to receive emails as they will come in through that email. If you sign up for a meeting, please check you have received your link well before the meeting as we do not check our emails during meetings. It is your responsibility to check that you have received your link - if you haven't received it and it's before meeting time, simply send your organizer (Kay R., Paige, Roby or Anthony) a PM and we will ensure you receive it.\n\nSome more general rules that will be reviewed in your First Timer's Meeting:\n\nDO NOT private message moderators/organizers unless you have a question regarding the group as a whole, or you didn't receive a link to the meeting. DO NOT message us for medical, legal, or general advice, and do not contact us to vent. We understand that times are tough and this is not an easy situation to deal with, but we are all running this group on a volunteer basis, and we do not have any medical or counseling degrees. If there is an emergency please call 911, contact your local police, hospital, or physician. There is also a domestic violence hotline (800.799.SAFE) and a suicide hotline (800-273-8255) - these are free 24 hour services. We appreciate your understanding in advance.\nDO NOT private message other members of the group. Again, this is an exception to the rule above, but if you see someone in a meeting you'd like to reach out to, please send the organizer of that meeting a message and we will ask that person if they consent to being contacted and will pass on your info to them. If a member tells you during a meeting to reach out to them, that is OK as they have consented already.
