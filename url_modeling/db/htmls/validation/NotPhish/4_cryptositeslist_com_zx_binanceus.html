Unlike conventional leveraged tokens (not managed by Binance), Binance Leveraged Tokens do not maintain a constant leverage ratio. Hence, Binance Leveraged Tokens only rebalance during extreme market movements. The rebalancing of positions of Binance Leveraged Tokens is governed by Binance’s proprietary algorithms with the aim to maximize correlation between Binance Leveraged Tokens and the underlying margin-leverage position without a profit-guarantee. \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eCommissions, fees and charges associated with Binance Leveraged Tokens\u003c/b\u003e\n      \u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore you invest or trade Binance Leveraged Tokens, you should obtain a clear explanation of all commissions, fees and other charges for which you will be liable.

Binance shall take reasonable steps, including, but not limited to, capital injection, additional tokens creation and selling tokens in the secondary market, token split or reverse token split to minimize the risks mentioned above. Users may redeem leveraged tokens at any time except during rebalancing. However, this will generally be more expensive than selling them on the spot market and is not recommended during normal trading times.
