LDO is also used to reward various DAO users and activities (as well as stETH and other assets within the treasury). Some common payments from the DAO have been grants, referral program payouts, liquidity incentives, insurance purchases, and bug bounties. Lido is a liquid staking solution for proof-of-stake (POS) blockchains, aggregating node operator partners who run the underlying validator infrastructure on the [Ethereum](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-blockchain-smart-contracts-dapps), [Solana](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/solana-blockchain), and [Terra](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/terra-luna-coin-fiat-stablecoin) blockchains. The project launched in December 2020 when Ethereum 2.0 (“beacon chain”), Ethereum’s POS chain, first entered Phase 0 and only allowed users to stake on [Ethereum 2.0](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-blockchain-pos-proof-of-stake) in multiples of 32 ETH. Once ETH is staked to the beacon chain, it cannot be bridged back to the original Ethereum (“Ethereum 1.0”). For example, Lido provides liquidity by issuing stETH in exchange for users depositing ETH, allowing them to earn staking rewards on Ethereum 2.0 while maintaining liquidity and reducing the 32 ETH requirement to any amount. When the beacon chain is rolled out, users will be able to “unstake” their stETH for the corresponding amount of ETH2 on the beacon chain. In essence, when holding any Lido st-assets, users can earn staking rewards while maintaining their liquidity. As of February 2022, Lido DAO has support for Ethereum 2.0, Solana, and Terra, with support for more POS blockchains to come. [You can see the LDO price and get more information by following the link](https://www.gemini.com/prices/lido-dao-token). \n\n![Blog Inline 03 - TOKE](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5Bx2x4jVRqXrqL2G1BlCow/a3038224201b26822f737523e31f058f/Blog_Inline_03_-_TOKE.png)\n__Tokemak (TOKE)__\n\nTOKE is an ERC-20 governance and collateral token compliant with the Ethereum network. Tokemak’s use cases include staking to reactors to govern liquidity deployment, incentivizing pools to maintain liquidity, serving as a collateral asset for LPs, and DAO governance (adding new reactors, setting fees, etc). Tokemak is a decentralized market making protocol that seeks to generate better capital efficiency for Liquidity Providers (LPs) across the DeFi ecosystem. Tokemak serves as a “liquidity router” that sits on top of decentralized exchanges, controlling the flow of liquidity as a means to provide cheaper and more seamless liquidity sourcing. Tokemak’s system is composed of “Reactors” and “Liquidity Directors”. The interaction between these allows for different protocols and DAOs to direct where their liquidity goes without having to rely on traditional incentives like high APY pools that can be inflationary. [You can see the TOKE price and get more information by following the link](https://www.gemini.com/prices/Tokemak). \n\n### Social Tokens\n![Blog Inline 01 - RLY](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1D8puNqFyFzNTukaNQZoYe/e737e799c5bf4487a170e05dd1f1a325/Blog_Inline_01_-_RLY.png)\n__Rally (RLY)__\n\nRLY is an ERC-20 governance and collateral token compliant with the Ethereum network. RLY’s use cases include: governance of the community treasury (voting and proposal creation), social token creation, liquidity for creator tokens, and community Rewards. The most popular application in the RLY ecosystem is Rally, a Web3 social token platform that allows content creators, brands, and celebrities to issue tokens. These tokens can then be used for any number of reasons as defined by token issuers, for example: access to private discord channels, use within a merch shop, access to NFTs. Whenever tokens are sold back from the creator token to RLY, a percentage of the sale is allocated to the creator. Creator tokens can be purchased using the RLY token, debit/credit cards, and other popular tokens, and can be sold back for RLY and then bridged back to Ethereum mainnet.

Central to that effort is the work we do to support the Bitcoin community through the [__Gemini Opportunity Fund__](https://www.gemini.com/opportunity-fund). \n\nThe Gemini Opportunity Fund is a donor-advised fund focused on making Bitcoin more scalable, secure, and sustainable through grants, fellowships, and donations. The fund supports a range of individuals, foundations, nonprofits, and projects that we believe will help to ensure the continued success of the Bitcoin Network.\n\nLaunched in December 2020, the Fund has pledged over $2.25 million to date toward supporting the Bitcoin community.\n\nBelow is an overview of the support we’ve provided through the Fund:\n\n### Bitcoin Core Developers\n\nIn 2021, we announced the sponsorship of four Bitcoin Core Developers: [Amiti Uttarwar](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar), [Dhruv Mehta](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developers-dhruv-mehta-and-jarol-rodriguez), [Jarol Rodriguez](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developers-dhruv-mehta-and-jarol-rodriguez), and [Michael Ford](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-sponsors-bitcoin-core-maintainer-fanquake).\n\n- __Amiti's__ main area of work is centered on the security of the Bitcoin Network, and the ways in which nodes connect and communicate with each other. Alongside other Bitcoin Core Developers, Amiti is building a secure, private, and non-influenceable way to store node addresses, enhancing the reliability of the Bitcoin Network. Check out [Amiti’s GitHub](https://github.com/amitiuttarwar?tab=repositories) and this piece about her [Bitcoin Core journey](https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365).\n- __Dhruv__ is passionate about the censorship resistance of the Bitcoin Network and has been working on BIP324, which introduces end-to-end encryption for Bitcoin peer-to-peer traffic. BIP324 adds encryption without overhead or risk of network partition, and provides the ability to observe directly. Check out [Dhruv's work on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489) and some [posts about Bitcoin](https://voluntarymind.com/bitcoin/).\n- __Jarol__ is focused on the Bitcoin Network’s graphical user interface (GUI), and is involved in revamping the GUI to enhance user flow and streamline multi-wallet support. Working with fellow Bitcoin Core Developers, as well as the vibrant Bitcoin design community, Jarol is building a functional, appealing, and intuitive user interface for the Bitcoin Network. Check out [Jarol’s work on GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml).\n- __Michael__ is currently a Bitcoin Core Maintainer, starting as a Bitcoin Core Contributor in 2012. His current projects include porting the macOS toolchain from a custom system to using the [vanilla LLVM programming library](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21778), and enhancing the Linux build system by implementing the use of [an alternative C programming library](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/23203).\n\n### Foundation and Nonprofit Support\n\n- [__MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-opportunity-fund-donates-to-mits-digital-currency-initiative) is building a team of senior, specialized open-source developers focused on systemic threat mitigation and rigorous improvements to Bitcoin's underlying infrastructure, including code audits, increasing automation, and novel research into Bitcoin's long-term economic security. The Gemini Opportunity Fund has pledged $1 million over four years to the Initiative. \n- [__The Human Rights Foundation’s Bitcoin Development Fund__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-opportunity-fund-launches-to-support-bitcoin-core-developers) supports Bitcoin developers working to enhance privacy on the Bitcoin Network and ensure that bitcoin is a tool for financial freedom. The Gemini Opportunity Fund provided an initial grant of $50,000 in BTC, which funded grants to Bitcoin entrepreneurs and educators __Farida Nabourema__ and __Roya Mahboob__. Farida is a Togolese human rights activist who is launching “Togo’s Bitcoin Academy,” a Bitcoin education project. Roya is an Afghan entrepreneur and Bitcoin educator who is relaunching “The Women’s Annex,” a platform facilitating bitcoin payments to female content creators. \n- [__Brink__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-opportunity-fund-launches-to-support-bitcoin-core-developers) is a London-based, non-profit fellowship program that will sponsor and mentor exemplary Bitcoin developers. Fellows will work closely with one another and be mentored by Brink founder John Newbery, formerly a Chaincode Labs developer, and Mike Schmidt, a Blockstream alumnus. The Gemini Opportunity Fund provided $150,000 in BTC to support Brink’s fellowship program. \n\n### Project Donations\n\n- [__Mempool.space__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-supports-bitcoin-ecosystem-with-usd25k-mempool-space-sponsorship) provides the crypto community with seamless visibility into the bitcoin blockchain without ads, altcoins, or third-party trackers, and we are privileged to have been the project’s first enterprise sponsor, donating $25,000 to support the team’s ongoing development. \n- [__Gemini Green__](https://www.gemini.com/green) is a long-term initiative to incorporate climate-conscious practices into our business. At Gemini, we’re committed to making crypto more environmentally friendly. To that end, in collaboration with Gemini Green, the Gemini Opportunity Fund has designated $1 million to support companies, projects, and nonprofits focused on sustainability in the crypto industry.\n- __Summer of Bitcoin__ is a global program that introduces student developers to Bitcoin and open-source development and pairs them with mentors. The Gemini Opportunity Fund donated $25,000 to support the program. \n\nWe are deeply committed to empowering the Bitcoin Network and look forward to expanding our support in 2022.

The SPELL token’s primary use cases are (1) governance in the Abracadabra protocol and (2) fees earned from the protocol. SPELL is used as the governance token for the Abracadabra.money decentralized platform. Abracadabra employs interest-bearing tokens as collateral in the minting Magic Internet Money (MIM), a USD-pegged stablecoin. Interest-bearing tokens able to be used as of February 2022 as collateral include liquidity provider (LP) tokens from Convex, Curve, Yearn, among others. The loan liquidation process on Abracadabra differs from other stablecoin/lending protocols like [MakerDAO](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/makerdao-dai-decentralized-autonomous-organization), in that each collateralized debt position (CDP) and its liquidation price is unique. Should the liquidation price for any specific CDP be crossed, a liquidator can purhcase the position by paying off the outstanding MIM. [You can see the SPELL price and get more information by following the link.](https://www.gemini.com/prices/spell-token)\n![Blog inline MIM](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5C3QdaA0KSqeb7goECC8ak/129fa312c089ab89a9c9ffd04f2261d7/Blog_inline_MIM.png)\n__Magic Internet Money (MIM)__\n\nMIM is an ERC-20 token, and is soft-pegged to USD. MIM keeps its peg via arbitrage incentives within the Abracadabra ecosystem. When MIM trades under USD1.00, arbitrageurs are incentivized to purhcase MIM at a discounted price, and potentially pay off some of their debt at a cheaper price than if MIM were USD1.00. If MIM trades above USD1.00, arbitrageurs are incentivized to borrow MIM and sell it at a premium. MIM is a USD soft-pegged stablecoin minted by the Abracadabra.money decentralized platform. Abracadabra uses interest-bearing tokens as collateral to mint MIM. Interest-bearing tokens able to be used as of February 2022 as collateral include liquidity provider (LP) tokens from Convex, Curve, Yearn, among others. The loan liquidation process on Abracadabra differs from other stablecoin/lending protocols like [MakerDAO](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/makerdao-dai-decentralized-autonomous-organization), in that each collateralized debt position (CDP) and its liquidation price is unique. Should the liquidation price for any specific CDP be crossed, a liquidator can purhcase the position by paying off the outstanding MIM.

Founder’s Nodes earn GALA by supporting the Gala Games Ecosystem on which games can run. Town Star, the first game built for the Gala Games Ecosystem, employs a reward structure whereby the top 100 players receive rewards in GALA. GALA is also serves as a non-refundable utility token which can be used as the medium of exchange between participants within the Gala Games Ecosystem. GALA can be used to purchase assets and NFTs. The Gala Gaming Ecosystem is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The project aims to create an environment where gamers retain full ownership of their in-game items, in contrast to the current centralized system (World of Warcraft, Minecraft, etc.) where players lose their in-game items when banned or when platforms shut down. For example, in Gala Games’ Town Star, players can own in-game items such as a CraneBot. The CraneBot in Town Star is an NFT and, more specifically, an ERC (Ethereum Request for Comment) token on the Ethereum blockchain. It exists on Ethereum’s network and is entirely separate from Gala Games. Furthermore, Gala Games cannot take away any NFT from a player.

It is the governance token for Merit Circle, and its public offering was held as an auction on the Balancer liquidity bootstrapping pool at an initial price of $1 USD. Decision-making is undertaken through voting by MC token holders. Merit Circle is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on maximizing yield across play-to-earn (p2e) games and the metaverse. The DAO manages capital allocated among managers and players to earn crypto assets by playing games. The project aims to develop opportunities to earn MC through play-and-earn platforms for people who want to help build the metaverse. Its platform hosts scholarship opportunities and educational opportunities to assist gamers on their journey towards earning crypto in the metaverse. The ecosystem is made up of gamers, community managers, and DAO contributors. Merit Circle was initially known as Axie 420, a scholarship program for the blockchain-based Axie Infinity game. With the rebrand, the DAO is focused on expanding beyond Axie Infinity into other crypto games. Collaboration efforts that Merit Circle has announced include Yield Guild Games, Sipher, UFO, Vulcan Forged, Nyan Heroes, and more.

The Render Network provides decentralized GPU-based rendering technology solutions. RNDR is its native utility token designed as the payment token for services offered by Render Network. The project consists of three major components working in conjunction: (a) creators, (b) node operators, and (c) OctaneRender. Using the Render Network, creators can tap into GPU power to render final images at higher speeds and lower costs than previously available. Node operators rent out their spare GPU to creators and receive RNDR tokens for time spent rendering. OctaneRender is the GPU rendering software used in the Render Network. [You can see the RNDR price and get more information by following the link.](http://www.gemini.com/prices/render-token)\n![Blog inline ENS](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4wXd3H6adXahrOvjfc39s9/03a0296aca4b365b2214fab1b5e12f78/Blog_inline_ENS.png)\n__Ethereum Name Service__\n\nENS is an ERC-20 utility token compliant with the Ethereum network. The ENS token was issued via an airdrop to all ENS domain holders, ENS contributors, and the ENS DAO community treasury. The airdrop could be claimed starting November 8th, 2021 and is open for claiming until May 4th, 2022. The ENS token will only be used for governance of the ENS protocol and community treasury at launch. Ethereum Name Service is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum network. ENS domains are issued as NFTs in the form of “Gemini.eth”, for example. The NFTs are meant to be human-readable addresses that map to public keys on networks like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and others. Other metadata can be stored within an ENS domain such as a traditional DNS domain like “gemini.com”, Twitter profile, IPFS hashes, and more. There are currently over 550,000 ENS domains owned by over 225,000 ethereum addresses, as of December 17, 2021.

Keep3rV1 or Keep3r Network is a registry designed to match organizations and other entities with technical professionals, known as Keepers, who can perform routine tasks such as collecting yield farming harvests. More specifically, a Keeper refers to an external person, bot, and/or team that executes an usually autonomous task, which is also known as a “job” in this context. A job can be as simplistic as calling a transaction or as complex as requiring extensive off-chain logic. The scope of the Keep3r Network is not to manage these jobs itself but to provide a matchmaking service. Each individual Keeper sets up their devops and infrastructure and creates their own rules based on what they want to accomplish. To become a Keeper and receive KP3R rewards from completing jobs, a Keeper needs to \"bond\" with a job. If a bonded Keeper is selected for a job, they will receive a reward once the job has been successfully completed.

The primary use case for CVC is for payment verification between Identity Verifiers and Identity Requesters within the Civic ecosystem. Civic is a decentralized digital identity provider that formed in June 2017. Civic provides a link between “Identity Verifiers” and “Identity Requesters,” where Requesters can be the Civic team themselves, or anyone who wants to link KYC/KYB (know your customer and know your business) data to crypto wallets. Identity Verifiers are paid in CVC by Identity Requesters and the Civic team takes fees for connecting the parties. Civic technology is also leveraged by its sister non-profit organization, Identity.com. Identity.com uses Civic to issue non-transferrable, non-fungible decentralized identity tokens to wallets called Civic Passes. Identity verification tokens can be used to gate specific dApps to create a KYC/KYB only decentralized exchange (DEX) or lending protocol. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) is made available only to dApps once the wallet owner gives permission. The requester (a DEX for example) will ask a Civic Pass wallet owner to permit the sharing of any relevant PII prior to providing access. Once the wallet owner accepts the request, the DEX will go to the Civic network and ask for PII validation of the wallet. A validator will attest the request and relay the results back to the DEX. Validators are then paid in CVC tokens by the DEX.

Dogelon Mars is a doge-themed token project that aims to replicate the success of Dogecoin (DOGE) while piggybacking on Elon Musk's plans to colonize Mars. The founders of Dogelon Mars locked 50% of all the ELON liquidity in a Uniswap liquidity pool. The other half was donated to a [wallet](https://etherscan.io/token/0x761d38e5ddf6ccf6cf7c55759d5210750b5d60f3?a=0xab5801a7d398351b8be11c439e05c5b3259aec9b) owned by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. Vitalik then sent the donated ELON to various DAOs and foundations, including the Methuselah Foundation, a non-profit medical charity focused on extending the healthy human lifespan. Since the founding team did not allocate any ELON to themselves, every token holder today either purchased the asset on a decentralized exchange (DEX) or received them as a donation from Vitalik Buterin.

During that downtime, all our customers' funds remained secure. In addition to maintaining our trading and custody platform, we have been working in parallel to upgrade our backend exchange platform to improve system capacity and scalability. This involved migrating 79 trading pairs on a coordinated schedule to a new platform while continuing to operate our exchange 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\nThis post provides additional information about the recent service disruption and how we are improving the reliability and performance of our exchange through a series of upgrades. \n\n__Incident Summary__\n\nPrior to the planned final migration of BTC/USD and ETH/USD to the new platform on Friday, we experienced a failure of the messaging infrastructure that this system depends on.\n\nThis messaging system is responsible for fast, high-capacity, reliable delivery of messages within our distributed exchange platform. It is multi-node and generally fault tolerant. Normally, this messaging infrastructure allows for strong reliability guarantees for applications that depend on it. All three nodes that make up this messaging platform failed at the same time with the same exception. The messaging system automatically restarted, but many internal message consumers and producers required manual intervention. After we restarted the impacted systems, it was determined that the messaging system errors led to state divergence of some downstream systems due to how our systems interacted with it.\n\nSince this incident occurred at a time when Gemini was transitioning order flow to an upgraded version of the exchange matching engine, the process of state reconciliation prior to restarting production services required reconciling state across two trading systems. Once state reconciliation was completed and all services were stable, markets were restored by first enabling ActiveTrader and API connectivity in limit-only mode, then re-enabling Mobile and Retail Web.\n\n__Incident Follow-Up__\n\nMoving forward and in support of our [chaos engineering approach](https://principlesofchaos.org/), we will ensure reproducibility of this failure mode in our test environments and improve our trading platform to gracefully degrade and recover from this kind of subsystem interruption. By ensuring we test this failure mode more frequently, we will be confident our systems can handle this and similar challenges well.\n\n__Improvements to Performance and Scalability__\n\nWe are very excited about the additional planned upgrades to our core exchange trading platform which we preview below and will detail more in a future post. The new system introduces multiple architectural improvements, including messaging improvements such as isolating the exchange’s high throughput, low latency messaging domain from the general purpose store/forward domain.\n\n![incident blog post image](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/79yrhbFTN05kPs065iRTyb/9653070ae5694549d8b88398e3be8dfb/incident_blog_post_image.png)\n\n*Scalable Exchange Architecture*\n\nBy isolating message traffic related to latency-sensitive trading operations such as order placement and order cancellation in this part of the system, we are able to observe improvements to the exchange’s performance that we’ll detail below.\n\nIn the process of developing the upgraded exchange system, we have developed tooling to measure multiple performance characteristics of the exchange. This includes an application that can measure round-trip time as observed by an internal order gateway, to give a general sense of latency distributions of a single order pipeline.\n\nBelow, we show the latency profiles for order placement in the new backend exchange platform.

In 48 hours, __28,983 collectors spent $91,806,519 to purchase 312,686 total units of *mass*__, which have now been merged to create unique NFTs for each collector of *mass*.\n\nThe record breaking doesn’t stop there. __*Merge* also generated the highest sales value by a living artist for a single artwork in a public sale__ — be it physical or digital art — a milestone that we are thrilled to be a part of. \n\nThe *Merge* collection debuted a compelling mechanism novel to the world of digital art, where collectors who bought multiple units of *mass* during the sale period unlocked access to an exclusive NFT that expands in size as more *mass* is added to their collection.\n\nFrom December 2 through December 4, users were able to collect as much *mass* as they wanted. At the end of the sale, owners of *mass* obtained a dynamic NFT that merged all the *mass* accumulated by each collector during the sale. Collectors who acquire more *mass* on the secondary market will “merge” purchased *mass* with their existing *mass* to grow their NFT.  \n\nThe mechanism allows for *mass* available on the secondary market to consolidate, lowering the total number of unique NFTs over time while the total units of *mass* remain constant. This pioneering approach highlights the social nature of art collecting and market scarcity, while utilizing NFT technology in an innovative way. \n\nAn enigmatic creator operating at the vanguard of digital art for decades, Pak specifically chose Gemini-owned Nifty Gateway to create this boundary-pushing artwork. Previously, Pak was central to developing the idea of Open Editions on Nifty Gateway. Open Editions allow collectors to purchase as many NFTs as they wish during the sale period for a fixed price in parallel to a collection that reveals itself over the course of the sale. In *Merge*, Pak created a new way to reward collectors that is uniquely possible using blockchain technology and Nifty Gateway’s infrastructure, powered by Gemini.  \n\nThe *Merge* NFT sale comes on the heels of a number of notable developments for Nifty Gateway. We recently became the first NFT platform to offer collectors [significantly reduced gas fees](https://medium.com/nifty-gateway/coming-soon-buy-and-sell-directly-from-your-ethereum-wallet-in-eth-on-nifty-gateway-d47e4f314e7a \"Nifty Gateway reduces gas fees\") (up to 70% lower) thanks to our unique custodial infrastructure. We also began listing NFTs from other marketplaces and enabling users to list NFTs in ETH directly from their wallets and buy directly from other users’ wallets in ETH. \n\nThe previous record for a single artwork sold publicly by a living artist was $91.1 million for Jeff Koons' 1986 sculpture, *Rabbit*, set in 2019. Earlier this year, digital artist Beeple sold an artwork, *Everydays: the First 5,000 days*, for around $69.3 million at a Christie’s auction, which held the previous record for an NFT sale.\n\nWe are thrilled to have worked with Pak on *Merge* to create an experience that united collectors from around the globe. As we continue on our mission to have 1 billion people collecting NFTs, we can’t wait to see where our community will take us next!\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nDuncan and Griffin Cock Foster  \nNifty Gateway Co-founders","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{"metaTitle":"Pak's Merge NFT on Nifty Gateway Breaks Record as Largest Public Art Sale by Living Artist","metaDescription":"Pak's Merge NFT Sale on Nifty Gateway Generated the Highest-Ever Sales Value by a Living Artist for a Single Artwork in a Public Sale.

The pseudonymous author (or authors) of the whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto, called the __revolutionary digital currency Bitcoin__. \n\nOver the past 13 years, Bitcoin has [grown into a global phenomenon](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/bitcoin-satoshi-nakamoto-genesis) ushering in a new wave of innovation across industries. It has inspired thousands of projects founded on blockchain technology, creating a dynamic community of developers, founders, investors, and users.\n\nAt Gemini, in addition to providing a secure and [reliable onramp to trade bitcoin](https://exchange.gemini.com/register) through our exchange, we support the Bitcoin ecosystem through grants, fellowships, sponsorships and donations made through the [Gemini Opportunity Fund](https://www.gemini.com/opportunity-fund). Earlier this year, we announced __the sponsorship of three Bitcoin Core Developers__: [__Amiti Uttarwar__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developer-amiti-uttarwar), [__Dhruv Mehta__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developers-dhruv-mehta-and-jarol-rodriguez), and [__Jarol Rodriguez__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developers-dhruv-mehta-and-jarol-rodriguez).\n\nToday, in honor of the Bitcoin whitepaper's 13th anniversary, we want to highlight some of the work Amiti, Dhruv, and Jarol have been doing to support the usability, security, and resilience of the Bitcoin Network.\n\n- __Amiti's__ main area of work is centered on the security of the Bitcoin Network, and the ways in which nodes connect and communicate with each other. Alongside other Bitcoin Core Developers, Amiti is building a secure, private, and non-influenceable way to store node addresses, enhancing the reliability of the Bitcoin Network. Check out [Amiti’s GitHub](https://github.com/amitiuttarwar?tab=repositories) and this piece about her [Bitcoin Core journey](https://medium.com/@amitiu/onboarding-to-bitcoin-core-7c1a83b20365). \n\n- __Dhruv__ is passionate about the censorship resistance of the Bitcoin Network and has been working on BIP324, which introduces end-to-end encryption for Bitcoin peer-to-peer traffic. BIP324 adds encryption without overhead or risk of network partition, and provides the ability to observe man-in-the-middle attacks directly. Check out [Dhruv's work on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/dhruv/5b1275751bc98f3b64bcafce7876b489) and some [posts about Bitcoin](https://voluntarymind.com/bitcoin/).\n\n- __Jarol__ is focused on the Bitcoin Network’s graphical user interface (GUI), and is involved in revamping the GUI to enhance user flow and streamline multi-wallet support. Working with fellow Bitcoin Core Developers, as well as the vibrant Bitcoin design community, Jarol is building a functional, appealing, and intuitive user interface for the Bitcoin Network. Check out [Jarol’s work on GitHub](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui-qml). \n\nBitcoin has proven itself deeply resilient, remaining the world’s most popular cryptocurrency and reaching a market cap of over $1 trillion. The strength of the Bitcoin Network is backed by a vibrant community of developers who are helping to maintain and enhance the network by working on the open-source Bitcoin Core. We are thrilled to support Amiti, Dhruv, and Jarol’s important work.\n\nOur industry is poised to continue scaling as more individuals and institutions make the leap into crypto. At Gemini, our mission is to empower the individual through crypto, and supporting the foundations of our industry is central to that goal.  \n\nIf you think you’re a great candidate for the Gemini Opportunity Fund or know someone who is, please reach out to us at [opportunityfund@gemini.com](mailto:opportunityfund@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{"metaTitle":"13th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper and the Emergence of a Global Movement","metaDescription":"13th Anniversary of the Bitcoin Whitepaper and the Emergence of a Global Movement.

Over the past weeks, we’ve discussed best practices for [securely logging on to your account](https://www.gemini.com/blog/logging-on-to-gemini-safely-two-factor-authentication) as well as [security features that help keep you safe while you trade](https://www.gemini.com/blog/trading-crypto-securely-on-gemini). \n\nToday, we’re breaking down best practices for withdrawing your crypto from Gemini. Whether you want to send crypto to a family member or use your crypto across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, there are security features on Gemini and general tips to keep in mind when moving your crypto off our platform. To start, you need to know __your recipient’s exact wallet address__ and you must be sure that __the target wallet address is compatible with the cryptocurrency that you’re sending__. \n\n__Build Your List of Approved Wallet Addresses__\n\nTo securely send your crypto from Gemini to another wallet, we recommend you start by building a list of approved wallet addresses. While this security feature is optional, building a list of approved wallet addresses can provide additional confidence that your crypto is being sent to your intended recipient and additional protection in the event your account is compromised.\n\nOnce you enable approved addresses, you’ll only be able to send funds to addresses on your approved address list. Keep in mind that any time you add a new wallet address to your approved address list, __a 7-day approval period delay__ will be triggered. This gives you time to double (or triple) check that you’ve entered the correct address and delete any erroneous addresses. If you enable approved addresses and leave the list empty, you effectively block all crypto withdrawals from your account, which can provide extra peace of mind if your strategy is to “[HODL](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=HODL).”\n\nYou can [learn more about approved addresses](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001411543-What-is-an-Approved-Address-) and how to [add one here](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027564891-How-do-I-add-an-approved-address-). Visit the following link to find and [configure approved addresses](https://exchange.gemini.com/signin?redirect=9b85d3883b18d26b2c652157af48c90852fd6d09-1634658166096-%2Fsettings%2FapprovedAddresses) in your account settings. \n\n__Blockchain Networks Supported by Gemini__\n\nAt Gemini, as we’ve continued to support more tokens for trading, we’ve expanded our blockchain compatibility to a number of networks beyond [Bitcoin](https://www.gemini.com/prices/bitcoin), including [Ethereum](https://www.gemini.com/prices/ether), [Dogecoin](https://www.gemini.com/prices/dogecoin), [Zcash](https://www.gemini.com/prices/zcash), and [Filecoin](https://www.gemini.com/prices/filecoin). However, we currently do not support sending tokens to chains like Polygon or Binance Chain. If you send tokens to unsupported networks, they will be unrecoverable, so please be extra careful that your target wallet is compatible with the token you’re sending as well as the network you’re sending it on. \n\nHere’s a list of [blockchain networks compatible with Gemini](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408420583835-What-networks-are-supported-for-Crypto-Deposits-and-Withdrawals-on-Gemini-):\n\n- Bitcoin (BTC)\n- Ethereum (ETH)\n- [Litecoin](https://www.gemini.com/prices/litecoin) (LTC)\n- [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.gemini.com/prices/bitcoin-cash) (BCH)\n- Zcash (ZEC)\n- Filecoin (FIL)\n- Dogecoin (DOGE)\n- [Tezos](https://www.gemini.com/prices/tezos) (XTZ)\n\nKeep in mind that while we support the ERC-20 versions of [Polygon](https://www.gemini.com/prices/polygon) (MATIC), [Fantom](https://www.gemini.com/prices/fantom-ethereum) (FTM), [Mirror](https://www.gemini.com/prices/mirror-ethereum) (MIR), [Terra](https://www.gemini.com/prices/terra-ethereum) (LUNA), and [TerraUSD](https://www.gemini.com/prices/terrausd-ethereum) (UST), we do not support the native versions of these tokens yet. When purchased on Gemini, ERC-20 tokens can be withdrawn to an Ethereum-compatible wallet for use across the DeFi ecosystem, but you’ll need to use a [bridge](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Bridge) if you want to withdraw these tokens to their native chains. If you withdraw the ERC-20 version of these tokens to a wallet associated with their native chains, without first bridging them from the Ethereum network, they may be unrecoverable. \n\nWe are thrilled to provide you with these cybersecurity tips and tools, and throughout the rest of October, we’ll continue to highlight important features and tips that can help you stay safe online.

In honor of Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we have outlined some steps you can take, and measures we have in place, to help keep your crypto secure throughout your Gemini journey. \n\n[As we outlined earlier this month](https://www.gemini.com/blog/logging-on-to-gemini-safely-two-factor-authentication), there are a number of actions you can take to protect your Gemini account — most notably, employing additional authentication methods like [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://www.gemini.com/blog/keep-yourself-and-your-cryptos-secure-with-one-simple-step). Behind the scenes, however, there are __further security measures we have in place to help keep your account and funds safe__.\n\n__Using Verified Devices to Access Your Gemini Account__\n\nWhenever you sign on from a new device, we’ll prompt you to verify your device. Device verification allows us to match your account to the devices you use most often, providing an extra level of confidence that you are the individual accessing your account. Keep in mind that this verification feature may also be triggered when you sign on to Gemini from a new or updated browser. \n\nWhen this occurs, you’ll receive an email from us asking if you just signed on from a new device. If you did not just attempt to sign on from a new device, a timely click of a link within the email will immediately place a hold on your account, keeping that malicious actor locked out and prevented from trading or withdrawing funds.\n\n__Password and Email Changes Trigger an Account Pause__\n\nAnother security feature we’ve integrated into our systems is a withdrawal hold on your account for at least 24 hours when you change an email address or password. Visit our Cryptopedia platform to learn more about [password best practices](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/how-secure-is-your-password-protection). \n\nA commonly used tactic by [attackers who compromise accounts](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/account-takeover-attack-meaning-and-protection) on web applications is to change the account information to lock the user out of their account. At Gemini, should your password or email address change, we’ll automatically block withdrawals on your account for at least 24 hours. In the event your account is compromised, this feature protects your funds by giving you a reasonable opportunity to take action and freeze your account.\n\nTogether with preventative measures like the use of two-factor authentication methods, including hardware security keys, these safeguards provide extra protection for your Gemini account. This is just a glimpse of the [security features](https://www.gemini.com/security) we have in place, and our security teams are committed to remaining ahead of the curve when assessing potential threats across our systems. \n\nOver the next couple weeks we’ll continue to provide you with information on the robust security measures we have in place to protect your crypto.

Over the next four weeks we’ll walk you through some steps you can take, as well as the safeguards we have in place, to secure your crypto from the time you log on to Gemini until you sign off. \n\nOur primary focus at Gemini is ensuring your crypto remains secure, and the most impactful step you can take is to __protect your login credentials__. Keeping your Gemini credentials safe and private is the first line of defense against being a victim of [an account takeover](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/account-takeover-attack-meaning-and-protection#section-how-to-prevent-account-takeover-fraud).\n\n__Use Two-Factor Authentication to Protect Your Account__\n\nAs a Gemini user you’ll be required to set up __two-factor authentication (2FA)__ on your account, providing you with an extra layer of security should your username and password be compromised. With 2FA set up on your account, you’ll be prompted to take an additional action alongside entering your password when you log in. This additional action can be 1) a one-time passcode that is generated by an authenticator app, 2) a one-time passcode delivered via an SMS message, or 3) a simple tap of a hardware security key like a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/).\n\n2FA has become a widespread security best practice in the cryptocurrency industry providing an important second layer of protection beyond your password. [Set up your 2FA](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038849612-Authy-Overview-and-Setup) by connecting your phone number or downloading an authenticator app, such as __Authy__, __Duo__, or __Google Authenticator__, which you then connect to your account via a QR code. __We recommend you use an authenticator app__, which secures your account against SIM swaps and is more secure than receiving a 2FA code via phone message. [Learn more about 2FA on Cryptopedia](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/how-secure-is-your-password-protection#section-medium-level-password-security). \n\n__Strengthen Your Account Security With Hardware Security Keys__\n\nTo really boost your online security, you can use a hardware security key, such as [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/?utm_source=Gemini-blog-oct15) or [Google’s Titan Key](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key), for all your important online accounts, including Gemini.\n\nA hardware security key not only protects you in the event of your password being compromised but also uses some clever design and mathematics to ensure that __your security key second factor is__ “[__unphishable__](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/phishing-attacks-explanation-safety-guide).” It provides the strongest level of protection by delivering hardware-backed, cryptographic proof of your identity, ensuring that only you, the holder of the physical hardware key, can gain access to your account — even if an attacker has compromised your password or successfully executed a [SIM swap](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/sim-swap-attack-preventing-crypto-fraud) on your mobile device.\n\nTo keep user accounts secure we use [The Web Authentication standard](https://webauthn.guide/), a top standard of hardware security key authentication for web applications. For more information, __check out this step-by-step process for__ [__setting up and using a hardware security key__](https://www.gemini.com/blog/keep-yourself-and-your-cryptos-secure-with-one-simple-step) to secure your Gemini account. \n\nIn the weeks to come, we will provide you with a number of other security measures to help you stay safe online.

What we saw in Bitcoin and, more broadly, crypto were tools to empower the individual and fundamentally impact the future of finance. \n\nNow in 2021, crypto has become a global asset class with a market cap greater than one trillion dollars, a testament to the dedication and enthusiasm of millions of people around the world. At Gemini, we are proud to have contributed to the growth of our industry and are inspired by what the future holds. \n\n__From a Small New York City Office to a Global Brand__\n\nWe started with a small and close-knit founding team in a tiny office west of Madison Square Park, an area of New York City now known as “Crypto Alley.” In merely six years, Gemini has grown into a global crypto platform with almost 600 employees across three continents and eight offices. We’re motivated by our continued growth, with our London colleagues recently [celebrating their one year anniversary](https://www.gemini.com/blog/one-year-of-building-gemini-uk), and the Asia Pacific team building [Gemini’s momentum across the region](https://www.gemini.com/blog/geminis-apac-expansion-builds-global-momentum). \n\nGemini’s global expansion mirrors the explosion of interest in crypto over the past six years. Launching initially as a one-asset exchange that just offered USD/BTC pairs, Gemini users can now buy, sell, store, and earn interest on [more than 50 cryptos](https://www.gemini.com/prices) including popular tokens like ether and Dogecoin, as well as the exciting cryptos powering the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) space. We’ve also made it easier to transit into crypto, expanding our fiat support beyond U.S. dollars (USD), to offer trading in British pounds (GBP), Euros (EUR), Canadian dollars (CAD), Australian dollars (AUD), Hong Kong dollars (HKD), and Singapore dollars (SGD), making Gemini a truly global exchange.\n\n__Imagining the Future of Finance__\n\nWe believe that Gemini will help shape the future of finance, and we’ve barely reached the bottom of the first inning for crypto. Over the past six years we’ve launched innovative projects and invested in compelling ideas, bringing incredible talent under the Gemini umbrella, acquiring four startups — [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/), [Blockrize](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-offer-credit-card-with-crypto-rewards), [ShardX](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-enhances-speed-and-scale-of-asset-listings-transfers-and-usage-with), and [Guesser](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-acquires-guesser-to-bolster-defi-opportunities) — since 2019.  \n\nEarlier this year we launched our interest-bearing product [Gemini Earn](https://www.gemini.com/earn), which allows Gemini users to earn interest on their crypto. We’re excited about the upcoming launch of the [Gemini Credit Card](https://www.gemini.com/credit-card), with which cardholders can earn crypto rewards on their purchases. We also launched [Cryptopedia](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia), an open-access, high-quality crypto education resource.\n\nWe’re thrilled about Nifty Gateway’s tremendous growth as the NFT space continues to draw interest from artists and collectors alike. Recently, the Nifty Gateway team released a [new site design](https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-the-new-nifty-gateway-design) with the aim of providing the best UI and UX in the NFT space, further unleashing the power of the ever-expanding Nifty Gateway community.\n\nAs we continue on our journey building the crypto universe, we are more excited than ever to work with innovative and driven individuals who want to join our mission.

Since our launch, we’ve been blown away by our incredible growth, partnerships, and colleagues who have joined our mission to make Gemini the go-to crypto exchange in the UK. \n\nTrue to Gemini’s ethos, we sought permission from regulators before launching in the UK. Gemini became one of the first and remains one of a handful of crypto exchanges registered by the Financial Conduct Authority under money laundering legislation in the UK, a testament to our commitment to offering UK customers the highest levels of safety and security. All of that is on top of our authorization as an E-money Institution, which means the fiat in your wallet is safer with us. \n\n__Boats, Pizza, and Giving Back__\n\nSince launching in September 2020,  we’ve certainly created a splash in the market. We proudly served as the principal sponsor of [The 2021 Oxford-Cambridge University Boat Race](https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-the-gemini-boat-race-2021), one of the oldest and most celebrated events in the UK sporting calendar. Broadcast globally, we reached enthusiasts of both crypto and sports with illuminated Gemini-branded rowing boats, and presented the victorious rowers with their trophies. \n\nEqually exciting, we launched the Gemini Bursary Fund to further develop the sport and provide young people from disadvantaged backgrounds across the UK with an opportunity to learn rowing. While initially intended to be capped at £75,000, it was so well received that we donated in excess of £81,000 to amazing social mobility sporting programs across the UK.\n\nOn Bitcoin Pizza Day, May 25th, we delivered pizzas to the remarkable staff of the National Health Service’s accident and Emergency centres across London to celebrate. As a small gesture, Gemini wished to thank medical workers for their incredible work and service during a gruelling year — a rewarding way to acknowledge a hallmark day for the industry! \n\n__A Growing Ship With More to Come...__\n\nWhat started as a three person team back in January 2020, has now grown into an entity attracting top quality expertise and world class talent across business development, compliance, customer service, engineering, financial crime, finance, marketing, and communications. With [more roles available on our website](https://www.gemini.com/careers) and further still in the pipeline, the UK talent stream at Gemini shows no sign of abating.\n\nGemini also [joined Take Five To Stop Fraud](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-supports-the-uks-take-five-to-stop-fraud-campaign) earlier this month, a national campaign to raise awareness of financial fraud. Joining the initiative, which is endorsed by the UK government and the largest banks and fintechs in the UK, is an important step on our mission to better protect consumers and raise awareness of fraud in the crypto industry. Gemini is committed to being a conscientious and demonstratively positive partner within the UK financial services industry. \n\nWe continue to cement strong relationships with local media, including the Financial Times, to share Gemini’s global and local story and affirm our position as thought leaders in crypto, financial regulation, custody, and DeFi. The UK team is further amplifying the Gemini message through a number of speaking engagements, including Token 2049 in October and Digital Asset Summit London in November, to further establish and build our presence in the institutional space. \n\nThank you to everyone who has supported our journey this past year and for all the international Gemini teams whose tireless work has helped us successfully launch in the UK. \n\nFor the year ahead, we look forward to welcoming new team members, growing our product offering, and continuing our work with global colleagues to empower individuals across the world through crypto. \n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nBlair Halliday  \nHead of Gemini UK","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"1Cjfbj0yPI4HwV9Si5gqj9","blogIntroduction":"To drive trust in our EFIL wrapping system, we provide on-chain proof of what the EFIL smart contract receives and generates.","datePublished":"Sep 23, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"exploring-wrapped-filecoin-efil-and-chainlink-proof-of-reserve","title":"Exploring Wrapped Filecoin (EFIL) and Chainlink Proof of Reserve","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"},{"id":"6YOO1AbXTB53ko4aLrGSGO","type":"Engineering"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"1DJWqPVRnCumGPsqmyhDA8","alt":"Blog Header - #EFIL","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1DJWqPVRnCumGPsqmyhDA8/336faf63f20af78de56515dadcbacbb5/Blog_Header_-_-EFIL.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"We [launched Wrapped Filecoin (EFIL)](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-launches-wrapped-filecoin-efil-building-a-bridge-to-defi) to provide Gemini users with a bridge to use Filecoin (FIL) across the ever-expanding DeFi ecosystem. Gemini users who hold FIL can convert their assets 1:1 into EFIL through the Gemini mobile app and website and seamlessly withdraw it to any Ethereum wallet.\n\nAt Gemini, we are dedicated to keeping your assets secure, and __we’ve implemented on-chain assurances throughout our EFIL minting process to establish confidence in the system__. The wrapping system we built employs an open-source smart contract to convert FIL into an ERC-20 token — EFIL. The smart contract mints and burns EFIL, and we transparently and trustlessly confirm the amount of available EFIL is equal to the amount of FIL held in Gemini Custody, our institutional-grade storage system.\n\nTo drive trust in our EFIL wrapping system, we provide on-chain proof of what the EFIL smart contract receives and generates. There are two main prongs to our approach: \n\n1. Integrating Chainlink’s well-established Proof of Reserve data feed, and \n2. using the hashing function SHA256, allowing anyone to track what happens in the EFIL smart contract. \n\n__Chainlink Proof of Reserve: Working With Trusted Oracle Infrastructure__\n\nWe are thrilled to collaborate with Chainlink to ensure the transparency of our EFIL wrapping system. By using the Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) data feed, which is powered by a [Chainlink decentralized oracle network](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/chainlink-oracle-what-is-chainlink-crypto), anyone can consistently check the balances of our FIL custody wallet. Should a deviation be spotted beyond a predefined threshold (e.g. 1%), Chainlink oracles will push an on-chain update to a specific reference contract that stores the EFIL reserve balance.\n\nDeFi platforms can also call the Chainlink PoR reference contract for current EFIL reserves and compare it to the circulating supply of EFIL on Ethereum to immediately verify the collateralization of EFIL. If EFIL is found to be under-collateralized, DeFi platforms can incorporate customized logic for handling such situations. \n\nOur collaboration with Chainlink brings additional protection to DeFi users of EFIL, preventing situations like black swan events and fractional reserve practices.\n\n__Ensuring Trust and Transparency__\n\nBy using Chainlink’s decentralized infrastructure, users interacting with EFIL can have confidence in __an accurate, highly available, tamper-resistant, and transparent source of information__ regarding current EFIL reserves. The result is a reliable form of collateral and payment throughout DeFi and other smart contract verticals on Ethereum. \n\nBeyond our collaboration with Chainlink, our engineers have built another level of transparency into the EFIL system by encoding on-chain the Filecoin content identifiers (CID) that correspond to each transaction using the SHA256 hashing function.\n![Blog Inline - #EFIL 01](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5zydPGX1xipRBrff7d4kyu/0390f214fd56c86b3028ef51f9a9d2db/Blog_Inline_-_-EFIL_01.jpg)\n![Blog Inline - #EFIL 02](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5lQMj3QtziNJFoP8iqbUcc/8b5e627f166d9c08bafa4094fde55811/Blog_Inline_-_-EFIL_02.jpg)\n\nThe above process shows that every transaction that increases or decreases the supply of EFIL on the Ethereum network can be tied to a corresponding transaction on the [Filecoin network](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/filecoin-fil-democratizing-cloud-storage). We believe that for observers of both chains this approach provides further proof that EFIL always wraps and unwraps on both chains and no excess EFIL is minted or burned.\n\nWe are excited to provide FIL holders with a transparent pathway onto the Ethereum network as we continue to empower the individual through crypto.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4drVuSwNUZRWYSkj1VUQjh","blogIntroduction":"We are proud to announce that Gemini has joined the Take Five Charter in the UK alongside other leading financial institutions, banks, and fintechs.","datePublished":"Sep 20, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"gemini-supports-the-uks-take-five-to-stop-fraud-campaign","title":"Gemini Supports the UK’s Take Five to Stop Fraud Campaign","blogAuthors":[{"id":"7dHNT73DWm71zqy8iCL5Mc","authorName":"Blair Halliday","authorPosition":"Head of UK","intro":"Blair Halliday is Gemini's Head of UK and joined in January 2020.","slug":"blair-halliday","profileImage":{"id":"1zdccvKY1O59S86hJwYPN9","alt":"Blair Halliday-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1zdccvKY1O59S86hJwYPN9/b28b7ffe79072acf53a67a68baed1f1f/Blair_Halliday-Headshot.jpg"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"EWqrVIYL52dpkwfQTAd5p","type":"Industry"},{"id":"4Qwc2juE1tmUQIRdsjs13","type":"Security"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"4pokaB52Ej7PC9aiqAFzun","alt":"Blog Header - #take5","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4pokaB52Ej7PC9aiqAFzun/1c03fcc245115cef6b3aaa34f3333d1e/Blog_Header_-_-take5.jpeg"},"blogPostContent":"Today, we are proud to announce that Gemini has [joined the Take Five Charter](https://getstarted.gemini.com/take5/) in the UK alongside other leading financial institutions, banks, and fintechs.

MCO2 holders can burn (or retire) their tokens on the moss.earth platform and receive a certificate that proves they have offset one tonne of carbon emissions. One MCO2 token is equal to one carbon credit (one metric tonne of carbon not released into the atmosphere) from a Verified Carbon Standard (VCS)-certified environmental project. VCS is the world’s most widely used carbon offset program, which uses a rigorous certification framework to verify carbon offsets. The proceeds from MCO2 tokenization have helped protect over 17 million hectares of the Amazon rainforest from deforestation, as of mid-2021. MOSS has directly contributed to avoiding 2 million tons of greenhouse gases from entering the atmosphere, as of mid-2021.

Players can earn AXS when they play various games within the Axie Infinity Universe and rank high on leadership boards. Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe built on Ethereum where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players build a land-based kingdom for their pets, or Axies, and can enter the game by purchasing Axies from other players on the Axie Infinity Marketplace. All in-game assets and Axie-related data can be accessed by 3rd parties, allowing community developers to build their tools and experiences in the Axie Infinity universe. You can see the [AXS price](http://www.gemini.com/prices/axie-infinity) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline SLP](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/BUuKCi31Q6l8eeJy4yLRC/ccb1ee61099b282a9f3d4b068eadfdaa/Blog_Inline_SLP.png)\n__Smooth Love Potion (SLP)__\n\nSLP is an ERC-20 utility token compliant with the Ethereum network and used on the Axie Infinity ecosystem. SLP can be earned as rewards by Axie Infinity players through battle or adventure mode. SLP can be used to breed new digital pets, known as Axies. Axie Infinity is a Pokémon-inspired universe built on Ethereum where anyone can earn tokens through skilled gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. On Axie Infinity, players build a land-based kingdom for their pets, or Axies, and can enter the game by purchasing Axies from other players on the Axie Infinity Marketplace.

We support the Ethereum (ERC-20) version of LUNA, which is a multi-chain asset. LUNA purchased on Gemini can be withdrawn to Ethereum compatible wallets and swapped to the native version of LUNA using a bridge. Terra is a blockchain protocol built on the Tendermint — Cosmos SDK that supports stable programmable payments and open financial infrastructure development. It is supported by a basket of fiat-pegged coins that are stabilized by LUNA. The Terra network aims to create a suite of stablecoins for decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TraFi) platforms. Terra achieves price stability by algorithmically adjusting its supply according to fluctuations in demand for LUNA and its stablecoins (TerraUSD, TerraSDR, etc.). In Terra's consensus model, LUNA holders do not need to stake their tokens directly but can delegate them to a validator. This allows most LUNA holders who don't want to set up a validator node to participate in staking rewards. You can see the [LUNA price](http://www.gemini.com/prices/terra-ethereum) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline WTON](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5UUDCj9ViCYAfEPAXAngMc/b1deed0923ff35c9f072072d1b2e7ea5/Blog_Inline_WTON.png)\n__Wrapped TON Crystal (WTON)__\n\nThe TON Crystal (TON) token is the native asset for the Free TON blockchain, and WTON is the Ethereum-wrapped (ERC-20) version of TON. WTON holders can exchange their assets 1:1 with the native TON token via the ton bridge. TON can be used to pay fees to TON validators and by validators to stake and become eligible to generate blocks on the Free TON blockchain. TON also serves as a governance token to vote on proposals for the Free TON blockchain. Free TON is a smart-contract platform based on Telegram's now-defunct TON blockchain project. The network employs a scaling technique called sharding that partitions storage and processing activities between smaller groups of validators. This process results in higher throughput and lower transaction latency when compared to other blockchains. You can see the [WTON price](http://www.gemini.com/prices/wrapped-ton-crystal) and more information by following the link. \n\n### Stablecoins\n\n![Blog Inline UST](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/3xjn9ZP2KcUv5l1oJ6wKTv/b88b6bc075e2a9165ff045ee944ccc4e/Blog_Inline_UST.png)\n__TerraUSD (UST)__\n\nTerraUSD (UST) is the decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra blockchain. Its value is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, making it an ideal medium of exchange on DeFi and TraFi platforms. We support the Ethereum (ERC-20) version of UST, which is a multi-chain asset. UST purchased on Gemini can be withdrawn to Ethereum compatible wallets and swapped to the native version of UST using a bridge. Terra is a blockchain protocol built on the Tendermint — Cosmos SDK that supports stable programmable payments and open financial infrastructure development. It is supported by a basket of fiat-pegged coins that are stabilized by its native crypto-asset, LUNA. Gemini does not support or guarantee UST’s 1:1 peg to the US dollar. You can see the [UST price](http://www.gemini.com/prices/terrausd-ethereum) and more information by following the link. \n\n![Blog Inline USDC](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/60GhsTH5iZxa7VnUlDL5Za/f18db652ab0b42e98fe5122e28fd4039/Blog_Inline_USDC.png)\n__USD Coin (USDC)__\n\nLaunched in October 2018, USD Coin (USDC) is a fiat-collateralized stablecoin built by the Centre consortium, a partnership between Circle and Coinbase created to develop price-stable crypto assets and network protocols. It offers the advantages of transacting with blockchain-based assets while mitigating price risk. USDC is an ERC-20 utility token compliant with the Ethereum network that is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It serves as an onramp to DeFi and as a means of digital payment. USDC can be transacted over the Ethereum blockchain in the same manner as Ether or any other ERC-20 asset. If a user wishes to redeem USDC they can send tokens to an address controlled by Centre members who will destroy the tokens and transfer fiat currency to the user's bank account. USDC’s existence on public blockchains allows traders and exchanges to use USDC as an alternative to fiat currencies. Gemini does not support or guarantee USDC’s 1:1 peg to the US dollar. You can see the [USDC price](http://www.gemini.com/prices/usd-coin) and more information by following the link. \n\n### Payments Tokens\n\n![Blog Inline ACH](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5Xyguj9A7vhsudoxvXFUTI/e8b3799da09f8a5c1f9600207b357de6/Blog_Inline_ACH.png)\n__Alchemy Pay (ACH)__\n\nACH is an ERC-20 utility token compliant with the Ethereum network and powers the Alchemy Pay platform. ACH is used to incentivize and reward network participants, and uses of the ACH token include pledging, staking, and fee discounts. Alchemy Pay is a hybrid crypto-fiat payment infrastructure powered by the ACH token. Alchemy provides merchants and customers with multiple options for settlement of both fiat and crypto. Alchemy Pay is building products to help reduce the friction of the legacy financial system through its hybrid crypto-fiat model. Primary product features include Smart POS for crypto, a Crypto Payment Gateway and an in-app Payment SDK (for merchants).

As part of that redesign, Gemini now mints a unique non-fungible token (NFT) for every new employee.\n\nThe designers we worked with, [Lucas Hearl](https://lucasallendesigns.com/ \"Lucas Hearl's website\") and [Frank J. Guzzone](https://www.frankjguzzone.com/ \"Frank J. Guzzone's website\"), provided 1) design parameters for how to randomly generate a 2D image, and 2) a 3D render of a badge to embed in the onboarding page. While originally the plan was to provide the 2D badge image as the NFT, I thought it would be cooler to dynamically generate a GIF/WEBM of the 3D badge and put the 2D badge image on it.\n\nThis post will walk you through how I used [three.js](https://threejs.org/ \"three.js\") to do just that! The code we'll write here isn't _exactly_ the same as the code used in production because I'll be using CodePen to run the examples, but the process is the same.\n\n## Preface: Slightly Above Beginner\nWhile I will be explaining my entire thought process, I won't be going into detail about every feature of three.js that I'm using. If you've never used three.js before, their documentation is comprehensive and they have [a great tutorial series](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene \"three.js tutorial\") to get you started.\n\n## Step 0: Show Me What You're Workin' With\nWe're going to take this static prerender of a badge provided to us by the designers,\n\n\u003cvideo autoplay muted loop\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"//videos.contentful.com/jg6lo9a2ukvr/32WdJ65g1Xs7dfB5mQanN7/59e6b6c1f4d8476d346b4a5a59892481/GEMINI_NFT_CARD_SPIN__1_.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"\u003e\n  Unable to load video.\n\u003c/video\u003e\n\nrecreate the badge in three.js,\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 2.2\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/dyWBjoE?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/dyWBjoE\"\u003e\n  Step 2.2\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nand put this image on it,\n\n![example NFT badge image](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1126KO3Cfz566AcA0T6kz5/32b21d802c111c2de0fea97a3d070526/emblem__1_.png)\n\nto make our final product:\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 4.2\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/VwbJdON?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/VwbJdON\"\u003e\n  Step 4.2\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Step 1: We Need a Box\nThe first thing we need is a project structure to work in and a basic badge to manipulate. I started with the structure of the three.js tutorial I linked to earlier and changed the z-dimension of the box to make it more badgelike.\n\n```js\nlet geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 1);\n```\n\nI then added an [AmbientLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/AmbientLight \"three.js AmbientLight documentation\") and switched the [MeshBasicMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshBasicMateria \"three.js MeshBashMaterial documentation\") (which doesn't interact with three.js lighting) to a [MeshStandardMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial \"three.js MeshStandardMaterial documentation\") (which does):\n\n```js\nlet light = new THREE.AmbientLight(0x414141, 10);\n\nlet material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial();\n```\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 1\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/MWmMBwr?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/MWmMBwr\"\u003e\n  Step 1\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nI also chose a [PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera \"three.js PerspectiveCamera documentation\") for the dynamic badge instead of the [OrthographicCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/OrthographicCamera \"three.js OrthographicCamera documentation\") that the designers used.\n\n## Step 2: Make the Box Shiny\nNow that we have the beginnings of a badge, we need to make it look metallic instead of a boring flat white. We can do this by adding some parameters to the [MeshStandardMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshStandardMaterial \"three.js MeshStandardMaterial documentation\") we're using for the box. While we're here, let's also tweak the depth of the box.\n\n```js\nlet metal = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n  color: 0xffffff,\n  roughness: 0.2,\n  metalness: 1\n});\nlet geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 0.1);\nlet badge = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, metal);\n```\n\nWe won't be able to see how reflective it is unless we add some point lights, so let's add placeholders for the softboxes from the render.\n\n```js\nlet pointLight1 =\n    new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100);\npointLight1.position.set(5,5,10);\nlet pointLight2 =\n    new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100);\npointLight2.position.set(-5,-5,10);\nlet pointLight3 =\n    new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100);\npointLight3.position.set(5,-5,10);\nlet pointLight4 =\n    new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100);\npointLight4.position.set(-5,5,10);\n\n...\n\nscene.add(pointLight1);\nscene.add(pointLight2);\nscene.add(pointLight3);\nscene.add(pointLight4);\n```\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 2.1\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/yLbdqNP?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/yLbdqNP\"\u003e\n  Step 2.1\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThat's getting closer, but the render has a different kind of metal on the front than the sides, which we can approximate with some changes to our material parameters.\n\n```js\nlet metal = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n  color: 0xffffff,\n  roughness: 0.2,\n  metalness: 1\n});\nlet roughMetal = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({\n  color: 0xc0c0c0,\n  roughness: 0.3,\n  metalness: 0.99\n});\nlet geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(10, 10, 0.1);\nlet badge = new THREE.Mesh(geometry,\n    [metal, metal, metal, metal, roughMetal, metal]);\n```\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 2.2\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/dyWBjoE?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/dyWBjoE\"\u003e\n  Step 2.2\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Step 3: What's on the Box?\nNow we just have to put the randomly generated unique badge image on the front of the badge! For the purposes of this article we aren't going to generate the image on the fly, but in production the front of the badge is unique to each employee.\n\nFirst, we need to load the image using a [TextureLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/loaders/TextureLoader \"three.js TextureLoader documentation\") and put it into a [MeshPhongMaterial](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshPhongMaterial \"three.js MeshPhongMaterial documentation\"):\n\n```js\nlet loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();\nlet badgeFront =\n    loader.load('https://i.imgur.com/Dq3ypnq.png');\nlet badgeFrontMaterial =\n    new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({\n  color: 0xffffff,\n  specular: 0x111111,\n  shininess: 200,\n  map: badgeFront,\n  transparent: true\n});\n```\n\nPutting it on the face of the badge in place of the rough metal means that _only_ the badge material we just made out of the image will reflect the light.\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 3.1\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/QWvXBjv?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/QWvXBjv\"\u003e\n  Step 3.1\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nTo get this to work the way we want, we're going to have to do something tricky. First, we're going to make a separate [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh \"three.js Mesh documentation\") with the same [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry \"three.js BoxGeometry documentation\"). Then we put the badge image on the same face as the rough metal (with no textures for the other surfaces), put it in the same location as the badge, and spin it at the same rate.\n\n```js\nlet badge = new THREE.Mesh(geometry,\n    [roughMetal, metal, metal, metal, metal, metal]);\nlet nifty = new THREE.Mesh(geometry,\n    [badgeFrontMaterial]);\n\nlet badgeGroup = new THREE.Group();\nbadgeGroup.add(badge);\nbadgeGroup.add(nifty);\n\n...\n\nscene.add(badgeGroup);\n\n...\n\nbadgeGroup.rotation.y += 0.015;\n```\n\nNow we do the same thing with the Gemini logo and put it on the back of our transparent badge.\n\n```js\nlet badgeBack =\n    loader.load('https://i.imgur.com/8McfMzg.png');\nlet badgeBackMaterial =\n    new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({\n\tcolor: 0xffffff,\n  specular: 0x111111,\n  shininess: 200,\n  map: badgeBack,\n  transparent: true\n});\n\n...\n\nlet nifty = new THREE.Mesh(geometry,\n    [badgeFrontMaterial, badgeBackMaterial]);\n```\n\nWhen you pass an array of materials to a [Mesh](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/objects/Mesh \"three.js Mesh documentation\") created with a [BoxGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/BoxGeometry \"three.js BoxGeometry documentation\"), three.js assigns those materials to the faces of the box in a specific order. The current orientation of the badge, camera, and lights means that if we pass the `badgeFrontMaterial` as the first array element, three.js will place the \"front\" of the badge on the current bottom of the badge. \n\nThere are a couple of ways to deal with this, but I chose to change the dimensions of the badge (which changes which side is the \"front\") and move the camera and lights around to face the new badge front. The net effect is that nothing changes visually, but it's easier for us to work with.\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 3.2\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/ZEKdjbx?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/ZEKdjbx\"\u003e\n  Step 3.2\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Step 4: Softboxes or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love RectAreaLightHelper\nTo get the softbox effect, we're going to replace our [PointLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/PointLight \"three.js PointLight documentation\")s with [RectAreaLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/RectAreaLight \"three.js RectAreaLight documentation\")s. While it might be possible for someone to picture in their head where the softboxes are relative to the badge and how they're being angled, I'm not that person. \n\nThankfully three.js provides a [RectAreaLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper \"three.js RectAreaLightHelper documentation\") that shows where the light is positioned and what direction it's facing. I added one helper per light, added [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls \"three.js OrbitControls documentation\") to the scene, and commented out the rotation in animate() so I could navigate around the scene to see precisely where I was putting the lights and how they were angled.\n\nTo replicate the softboxes we take a still image of the back of the badge from the static render.\n\n![still image of the back of the prerendered spinning badge](//images.contentful.com/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6mykQPNr4u4SzDFEsOhJCk/8f4a65007d7a3f79a9231f88fad93822/Screen_Shot_2021-04-23_at_3.49.11_PM.png)\n\nThen we go softbox by softbox: pick a softbox from the still image, put a [RectAreaLight](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/lights/RectAreaLight \"three.js RectAreaLight documentation\") in with its [RectAreaLightHelper](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/helpers/RectAreaLightHelper \"three.js RectAreaLightHelper documentation\"), and move it around and change its color and brightness until it looks right. \n\nThis part is easier if you recognize that the designers are trying to make a virtual replica of a photography softbox setup and you [do some research about what softbox setups look like](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch\u0026q=softbox%20setup\u0026tbs=imgo:1 \"Google Image search for \"softbox setup\"\"). Getting these in the right place and at the right brightness is really fiddly so I'll just show the OrbitControls and RectAreaLightHelpers enabled (click and drag your mouse to move around, scroll in and out to zoom).\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 4.1\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/RwVzBrN?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/RwVzBrN\"\u003e\n  Step 4.1\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe final product!\n\n\u003ciframe height=\"500\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Step 4.2\" src=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/embed/VwbJdON?default-tab=js%2Cresult\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"\u003e\n  See the Pen \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini/pen/VwbJdON\"\u003e\n  Step 4.2\u003c/a\u003e by baron-gemini (\u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io/baron-gemini\"\u003e@baron-gemini\u003c/a\u003e)\n  on \u003ca href=\"https://codepen.io\"\u003eCodePen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAnd, there we've done it!

You can now easily convert [Filecoin (FIL)](https://www.gemini.com/prices/filecoin) into EFIL and move it seamlessly onto the Ethereum network, providing more opportunities to create value across the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem. \n\nAll Gemini users who hold FIL can __convert their assets 1:1 into EFIL__ through the Gemini Mobile App and Website using the __wrap__ button on the FIL price page. You can also purchase FIL and immediately wrap it by toggling “Wrap Your Filecoin Purchase” before completing your order. You can unwrap your EFIL to receive FIL by visiting the [EFIL price page](https://exchange.gemini.com/buy/EFIL).*\n\nOnce you hold EFIL in your Gemini wallet, you can withdraw it to any Ethereum address you specify. You’ll be able to use EFIL across various Ethereum-based protocols, including DeFi platforms.\n\nAll minted __EFIL will be backed 1:1 by FIL held in Gemini Custody__, our institutional-grade storage system. As a qualified custodian regulated in New York, the safety of our clients’ assets is our top priority, and we employ top-of-the-line security, compliance, and operational protocols across our custody product — ensuring your assets remain secure.\n\nWe are also __excited to extend our collaboration with CoinList__, which will also offer EFIL wrapping for their customers, providing another avenue to interact with the EFIL smart contract while creating more opportunities for users across the Filecoin and Ethereum ecosystems. CoinList already supports [wBTC and tBTC](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/wtbtc-vs-tbtc) minting on its platform, and will now allow users to instantly convert FIL for EFIL, and vice versa, via the CoinList Wallet.\n\nTo develop this wrapping functionality, we built our own open-source Ethereum smart contract that wraps FIL and converts it into an ERC-20 token — EFIL. The EFIL smart contract mints and burns EFIL, and ensures that the amount of available EFIL is equal to the amount of FIL held in Gemini Custody.\n\n[Filecoin](https://gemini.com/blog/upcoming-support-for-filecoin) is the native token of the Filecoin Network, a decentralized data-sharing platform. FIL is used to purchase storage space on, and retrieve files (i.e., data) from, the [Filecoin Network](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/filecoin-fil-democratizing-cloud-storage). Miners receive FIL for storing your files and verify their services via cryptographic proofs. This decentralized model offers a compelling alternative to existing centralized cloud storage offerings.\n\nAt Gemini, we offer trading for more than __45 cryptos__, with a further __14 cryptos__ available for custody. Learn about all the cryptos we support, and more, [here](https://www.gemini.com/prices).\n\nAs DeFi continues to show its far-reaching potential to redefine financial services, we are dedicated to empowering you, the individual, with more opportunities to engage across Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. __EFIL is just our first act__.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n**[Fees apply](https://www.gemini.com/fees/mobile-fee-schedule)*","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"53tyfWgMrJZkaDfcGnsQ2h","blogIntroduction":"Brave Rewards users can have their Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) seamlessly deposited into a Gemini account through the new Gemini User Wallet.","datePublished":"Aug 31, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"gemini-now-provides-an-integrated-crypto-experience-for-brave-users","title":"Gemini Now Provides an Integrated Crypto Experience for Brave Users","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"EWqrVIYL52dpkwfQTAd5p","type":"Industry"},{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"qYu55Of25XIP1vfIEQllE","alt":"Brave-Gemini Partnership-Blog Header","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/qYu55Of25XIP1vfIEQllE/abdc7b1b57574e5dc8fa833f78c58ce8/Brave-Gemini_Partnership-Blog_Header.png"},"blogPostContent":"Today, we are thrilled to announce that [Brave Rewards users](http://www.gemini.com/brave) can __have their Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) seamlessly deposited into a Gemini account through the new Gemini User Wallet.__\n\nOne year ago we launched our [partnership with Brave](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-integrates-with-brave-for-trading-and-wallet-support), providing crypto wallets for Brave Creators and adding the Gemini Trading Widget to the Brave browser.

We’ve seen our very own Nifty Gateway achieve [explosive growth](https://www.gemini.com/blog/the-explosive-rise-of-nifty-gateway-and-digital-art). With all this excitement, we’re eager to explore where the space is headed with a particular focus on what value an open royalty standard can bring to NFT creators. \n\nIf you ask participants in the NFT ecosystem what they’re most excited about, you’ll likely hear various different responses, such as:\n\n- Investing in a new asset class\n- Being part of a community\n- Opportunity to resell for profit\n- The positive long term impact of NFT technology\n\nHowever, a lingering promise since the inception of NFTs, is the idea that there is now *a new medium for creators to monetize their work*. More specifically, royalty payments can now be seamlessly facilitated through blockchain infrastructure. \n\nCreators have already been making use of the existing royalty payment solutions, and many have already been able to realize a newfound passive income stream. So, what’s the problem? \n\n__The NFT Royalty Landscape Today__\n\nNFT standards ([ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)) are built on [Ethereum](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-blockchain-smart-contracts-dapps). Broadly speaking, marketplaces transfer ownership of NFTs between collectors upon a sale. These transfer mechanisms are made *easy* because of the open standards that exist. These standards have facilitated the proliferation of many NFTs we see today, of course with the exception of some that predated their creation e.g. [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). \n\nAt the time of this writing, an open royalty payment standard is not ubiquitous in the Ethereum ecosystem. Royalty information is siloed to marketplaces and generally not shared. This means that if an NFT is moved off a platform and then sold, the creator won’t receive the royalties that they’re entitled to. \n\n[EIP-2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981) is a standard that focuses on signalling to market participants the royalty payment information for a given NFT or set of NFTs. It allows for attaching royalty information to the token itself, thereby making use of a common data store and computation layer that *all* participants can access — the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nAfter nearly one year of [discussions](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2907), EIP-2981 was finalized on July 24, 2021. \n\n__How Does it Work?__\n\nIt’s pretty simple. The crux of the problem can be solved by overriding a single [Solidity](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Solidity) function in your smart contract.\n\n```\n/// @notice Called with the sale   \nprice to determine how much royalty\n//          is owed and to whom.\n/// @param _tokenId - the NFT asset   \nqueried for royalty information\n/// @param _salePrice - the sale   \nprice of the NFT asset specified by   \n_tokenId\n/// @return receiver - address of   \nwho should be sent the royalty payment\n/// @return royaltyAmount - the   \nroyalty payment amount for _salePrice\n\nfunction royaltyInfo( \n    uint256 _tokenId,\n    uint256 _salePrice\n) external view returns (\n    address receiver,\n    uint256 royaltyAmount\n);\n```\n\nThe general goal of EIP-2981 contributors is to provide a [gas](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=gas)-efficient solution while avoiding restrictions on future royalty payment improvements. The simplicity of its design is intentional, with the aim to make adoption simple. As with any standard, adoption is key to its utility. \n\nIn the usual case, for a given NFT *`_tokenId`* and *`_salePrice`*, the *`royaltyInfo`* function will perform a percentage calculation to produce the necessary (and undisputed) information to craft a royalty payment transaction. \n\nNotice how the function does not concern itself with currency. The existing standards for NFTs (ERC-721/1155) are currency agnostic. In fact, if we zoom out a little, NFT smart contracts aren't even aware of the concept of a \"sale\". When it comes to more abstract concepts like sales, it is the marketplaces that facilitate them. As a reminder, two key actions occur when a sale takes place:\n\n1. A transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller \n2. A transfer of the NFT from the seller to the buyer\n\nAs far as the NFT smart contract is concerned, it can’t tell if an invocation of [`safeTransferFrom`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md#specification) was a simple transfer of the NFT to another address or an actual sale event. This alone makes enforcing royalty payments on-chain challenging. Specifically when you’re conforming to existing standards that aren’t built with this in mind. \n\nIt’s important for marketplaces supporting EIP-2981 to consider the currency that the NFT sale was denominated in. The royalty calculation should be in the same denomination. So, if an NFT was sold for 45×10\u003csup\u003e18\u003c/sup\u003e [Wei](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/glossary#wei) (45 Ether), then the *`royaltyAmount`* returned from the function would be in the expected denomination (Wei). With that in mind, let’s jog our memory on the fact that math in Solidity does not support fractions and suggest one possible workaround:\n\n1. 2.5% of the *`_salePrice`* should be sent to the receiver, we know that 2.5% of 45 Ether is 1.125 Ether. However, Solidity will compute 1 Ether:\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e`uint256 result = (uint256(45) * 250) / 10000;`\n\n2. More precision is required, so we can convert Ether to Wei; 45 Ether is now 45×10\u003csup\u003e18\u003c/sup\u003e Wei and Solidity will compute 1.125×10\u003csup\u003e18\u003c/sup\u003e Wei or 1.125 Ether:\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e`uint256 result = (45000000000000000000 * 250) / 10000;`\n\nThis highlights a potential pitfall that Solidity engineers should be no stranger to. That is, the *`_salePrice`* should be sent in the smallest denomination of the currency tendered. This reduces the likelihood of disputes with respect to how Solidity performs arithmetic operations. To further ensure that precision is kept, implementers should consider using basis points (bps). Notice how 2.5% is denoted as 250 bps and 100% is 10,000 bps. This common unit of measure for percentage interest rates in finance works well here. \n\nIn addition to this, it’s advised to extensively unit test this function before deploying to production. Call sites invoking this function can also check that the *`royaltyAmount`* value that was calculated is sensible \ne.g. *`royaltyAmount \u003c _salePrice`*.\n\n![Blog inline - NFT Royalty Standard](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2X6EoBafKOBBNtPiGUGhta/7066605b86e4e3fa2bd7d424bce4977b/Blog_inline_-_NFT_Royalty_Standard__1_.png)\n*Image credit: [knownorigin](https://medium.com/knownorigin/eip-2981-simple-and-effective-royalty-standards-for-all-dbd0b761a0f0)*\n\n__EIP-2981 in Action__\n\nA nice example of EIP-2981 in action can be found at this [example implementation](https://github.com/dievardump/EIP2981-implementation). Here we can see royalties implemented on a *per token* basis. In contrast, we can also see globally applied royalties, where every token is associated with the *same* royalty information. This can be achieved relatively easily with some small tweaks to the smart contract.\n\nThe cryptocurrency space is known for pushing the boundaries and testing assumptions of existing systems. EIP-2981 is no exception — engineers and enthusiasts can get creative with how the *`royaltyInfo`* function is implemented. Some interesting approaches might include:\n\n- __Fixed royalties__ — this is expected to be the common case where a static percentage is used for every sale.\n- __Decaying royalties__ — reduce royalties owed for every transfer event of the NFT over time.\n- __Multisig royalties__ — the receiver address could be a multisig smart contract. It may represent a DAO or some effort towards public goods funding.\n- __Stepped royalties__ — don’t send royalties if the sale price is below a threshold.\n\nMany contributors see this standard as a necessary building block towards a more open royalties system. For the most part, there's a particular focus on socially enforced royalties; a system where incentives between participants align such that leaving royalties unpaid is disincentivized. It’s a common belief that this approach could prove to be very resilient, and further reinforced by more transparency with respect to royalty payment obligations. \n\n__What Next?__\n\nFor EIP-2981 to become widely supported we must __raise awareness__. Gentle forces can be applied to marketplaces by artists who request it. In addition to this, marketplaces can also anticipate the demand and implement it sooner. \n\nAll things considered, marketplaces will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to support the EIP-2981 standard. With some familiar names in the NFT landscape already supporting it, we’re optimistic others will follow.\n\nWe see this as an exciting development and one to keep a close eye on in the coming months. \n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nBlaine Malone \u003cbr/\u003e\nStaff Software Engineer, Research \u0026 Development \u003cbr/\u003e (Co-author of EIP-2981)\n\n*Decentralization and transparency are central to crypto's ethos.

We’re on a mission to empower the individual through crypto, and we want to make sure we do so in a sustainable way.\n\n[Gemini Green’s](https://www.gemini.com/green) initial focus is the energy consumption of the Bitcoin Network, namely the energy used by miners to secure the network. Many miners use renewable energy sources, which emit no carbon dioxide into the atmosphere; however, some miners do not. In an effort to offset the latter, we used reputable data sources to determine the annualized carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network and then estimated Gemini's usage of the Bitcoin Network to understand our exposure to non-renewable mining. With this information, we have collaborated with Climate Vault, a non-profit organization founded by the University of Chicago, to purchase carbon permits to offset our exposure for the first half of this year. And we plan to continue to do so into the future. We discuss our results, methodology, and implementation below. \n\n__Result__\n\nWe have spent __$4,031,767.35__ to purchase carbon permits to offset the carbon emissions related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network from January 1 to June 30, 2021. These carbon permits will prevent __341,965 metric tons of carbon from entering the atmosphere__ — the equivalent of nearly a billion miles driven by a typical passenger car.\n\n__Methodology__\n\nThe Bitcoin Network’s energy consumption is a result of miners competing for the bitcoin block reward. This competition involves a computationally-intensive, proof of work (PoW) puzzle, whereby the “winning” miner is rewarded with a set number of bitcoin roughly every 10 minutes. This competition secures the Bitcoin blockchain and continues regardless of whether or not there are any transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Therefore, we define our “usage” of the Bitcoin Network as the portion of the mining process that we benefit from, or rather, the amount of energy consumed by miners to secure the bitcoin that Gemini custodies. We believe that this custody-based approach more accurately reflects Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network as opposed to a transaction-based approach, which ignores the fact that bitcoin at rest are secured by the mining process.\n\nAs a result, we calculated the amount of bitcoin we custody as a percentage of the circulating supply of bitcoin to determine our usage of the Bitcoin Network and then applied this percentage to the Bitcoin Network’s total energy consumption to estimate the energy consumption related to our usage. We then offset the energy consumption related to our usage that we estimate to involve non-renewable mining. \u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n__Step 1__: Calculate Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gemini’s average daily bitcoin balance / Average daily bitcoin in circulation \u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e \n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;= Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;250,843 BTC / 18,660,225 BTC = __1.34%__\n\n__Step 2__: Calculate the energy consumed by miners related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network (2021 YTD).\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network x the Bitcoin Network’s average \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;annualized energy consumption \u003csup\u003e2\u003c/sup\u003e = energy consumed by miners related \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network \n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;1.34% x 106.6913 tWh = __1.434215 tWh__\n\n__Step 3__: Calculate the carbon intensity of the energy used by the Bitcoin Network. “Carbon intensity” is defined as the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed. \n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Annualized carbon footprint of the Bitcoin Network \u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e / Projected annual \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;energy usage of Bitcoin network = carbon intensity of the energy used by \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;the Bitcoin Network \u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;60.40 Mt CO2 / 126.66 tWh = __476,867.20 mT CO2 / tWh__\n\n__Step 4__: Calculate the carbon emissions related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;(Energy consumed by miners related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Network x carbon intensity of the Bitcoin Network) x (days/year) = \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Carbon emissions related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;(1.434215 tWh x 476,867.20 mT CO2 / tWh) x (182.5/365) = __341,965 mT \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;CO2__\n\n__Step 5__: Calculate the cost to offset the carbon emissions related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network.\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Carbon emissions related to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network x cost \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;per permit to emit 1 mT CO2 = cost to offset the carbon emissions related \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;to Gemini’s usage of the Bitcoin Network\n\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;341,965 mT CO2 x $11.79 per permit / 1 mT CO2 = __$4,031,767.35__\n\n\u003csup\u003e1 Bitcoin Blockchain (source:\u003c/sup\u003e \u003csup\u003e [Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin))\u003c/sup\u003e  \n\u003csup\u003e2 We used publicly available data from the [Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://cbeci.org/) and the [Digiconomist Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption/) to determine Bitcoin’s average annualized electricity consumption.\u003c/sup\u003e  \n\u003csup\u003e3 We used the data and methodology of the Digiconomist Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index to estimate a carbon intensity coefficient (“Carbon Footprint” and “Estimated TWh per Year”, both as of June 8, 2021).\u003c/sup\u003e  \n\n__Implementation__\n\nGemini Green has teamed up with [Climate Vault](https://climatevault.org/) to offset our carbon emissions. Climate Vault engages directly with government-regulated cap-and-trade markets to buy carbon permits and remove them from circulation by “vaulting” them, which prevents other market participants from using them to emit CO2 and reduces the overall supply of carbon permits, making it more expensive for businesses to pollute. Climate Vault also supports the development of cutting-edge carbon capture and sequestration technologies, further accelerating the removal of carbon from the atmosphere. \n\n__Looking Ahead__\n\nIn addition to purchasing offsets, we have allocated $1 million through the [Gemini Opportunity Fund](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-opportunity-fund-launches-to-support-bitcoin-core-developers) to support companies, projects, and nonprofits that are focused on sustainability in the crypto industry.

The listing of a DeFi token on Gemini does not indicate that Gemini or any regulatory authority has endorsed the underlying project or protocol. While some of our customers may choose to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, Gemini makes no recommendation that they do so.*\n\n*Updated: June 17, 2021*\n\nLearn more about these new tokens below:\n\n### DeFi Tokens\n\n![Blog Inline ALCX](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5J928HabPF5ljTcOehR9WB/854da458b5cafe170fe2ea15f2307755/Blog_Inline_ALCX.png)\n__Alchemix (ALCX)__\n\nALCX token is an ERC-20 token used to govern and incentivize liquidity for the Alchemix protocol. Its primary use cases are governing the Alchemix decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and rewarding network participants for providing liquidity. Alchemix is an innovative, hybrid DeFi application that allows for the creation of yield-backed synthetic assets. With its unique ability to provide collateral that can also generate yield, Alchemix can offer a self-paying loan that has effectively no risk of liquidation. This product, “Vaults”, is the centerpiece of the Alchemix ecosystem and uses Yearn.finance as a building block for yield on underlying assets like DAI, with support for ETH and others coming soon. You can see the [ALCX price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/alchemix) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline MIR](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6RFQol5CKgJvnh9v2US7iO/1b1df9752a4ad1fbd88beef1397b3fe3/Blog_Inline_MIR.png)\n__Mirror Protocol (MIR)__\n\nMIR is a utility and governance token that powers the Mirror Protocol. We support the Ethereum (ERC-20) version of MIR, which is a multi-chain asset. MIR purchased on Gemini can be withdrawn to Ethereum compatible wallets and swapped to the native version of MIR using a bridge. MIR has various use cases including protocol governance and rewarding liquidity providers on the platform. Holders of MIR can also engage in yield farming on other DeFi platforms by staking MIR tokens. In the future, users will be able to use MIR tokens as collateral to mint mAssets and a variety of derivative products. Mirror Protocol is a DeFi protocol powered by smart contracts on the Terra network that enables the creation of synthetic assets called Mirrored Assets (i.e., mAAPL, mTSLA, etc.). These mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets. You can see the [MIR price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/mirror-ethereum) and more information by following the link.\n\n### Infrastructure Tokens\n\n![Blog Inline ANKR](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4x1R5DaCAUmn0Uj6qrD3H/992124354b1ff7c3bc9818d15b88db1f/Blog_Inline_ANKR.png)\n__Ankr Network (ANKR)__\n\nANKR is an ERC-20 token that powers the Ankr Network. Its use cases include being a mode of payment for services on the Ankr platform, such as node deployment and API services, participation in on-chain governance, and serving as insurance for network participants. Ankr Network provides Web3 infrastructure for easy, accessible, and affordable deployments of a broad range of blockchain nodes, APIs, and decentralized cross-chain staking infrastructure. It is designed to lower entry barriers for retail and enterprise clients and developers who want to contribute to blockchain ecosystems. To increase adoption and contribution to various blockchain ecosystems, Ankr has teamed up with a range of notable partners over the years, including but not limited to companies like Avalanche, Binance, Blockstack, Compound, Covalent, Celo, Curve, Elrond, Harmony, Oasis, Polygon, Skale, and many more. You can see the [ANKR price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/ankr) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline FTM](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4Bekpgdkj06hcCArQM6PAW/e4123e6d247a765d446d63724db98f37/Blog_Inline_FTM.png)\n__Fantom (FTM)__\n\nFTM powers the Fantom network, and is used for staking, on-chain governance, and as payment for network fees. We support the Ethereum (ERC-20) version of FTM, which is a multi-chain asset. FTM purchased on Gemini can be withdrawn to Ethereum compatible wallets and swapped to the native version of FTM using a bridge. When interacting with the Fantom network, users pay gas fees (or transaction fees) in FTM tokens. The Fantom network is a smart-contract platform that allows developers to write, compile, and deploy smart contracts the same way they can on Ethereum. It runs on a directed acyclic-graph-based distributed ledger and is integrated with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Web3JS stack. It uses an asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (aBFT) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism called \"Lachesis.\" You can see the [FTM price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/fantom-ethereum) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline DDX](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5tGRE6gZZZs389QOuPSCrg/58fde0a07e3d52fd93f1a8548db2c990/Blog_Inline_DDX.png)\n__DerivaDAO (DDX)__\n\nThe DDX token is an ERC-20 governance and utility token with various use cases. DDX allows token holders to participate in the governance of DerivaDAO from day one with their token holdings (or delegated voting power) to determine the evolution of the exchange. DDX can also be used to pay reduced trading fees on the platform, and the token is staked (or bonded) by operators who run price feeds or matching engines. Lastly, DDX holders can stake the token to receive increased referral payouts from traders they have referred to the platform. DerivaDAO is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that governs DerivaDEX, a Coinbase-backed decentralized exchange (DEX) for derivative contracts built on Ethereum. It features an open order book and on-chain settlement, and leverages off-chain price feeds, matching engines, and liquidation operators to enable fast and efficient transactions of synthetic assets. You can see the [DDX price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/derivadao) and more information by following the link.\n\n### Data Management Tokens\n\n![Blog Inline API3](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/TtKAIq6ol1CN0FX6w9s87/1b0549e0a89a1fc9ea419f52f1ce1076/Blog_Inline_API3.png)\n__API3 (API3)__\n\nAPI3 is an ERC-20 utility token. Token holders stake assets in API3’s insurance collateral pool in order to participate in the protocol's governance. API3 is a collaborative project delivering traditional API services to smart contract platforms in a trust-minimized and decentralized fashion. A collateral pool protects against issues that may arise from any disruption caused by data distribution. When a user receives incorrect data, the pool is slashed and the user receives the slashed funds as compensation. API3 is governed by the API3 DAO. API3's code is open source, and provides transparency into its operations.

This trust will HODL all the bitcoin donated to it until 2025.\n\nThis new charity model — the __HODL MODL__ — creates a new paradigm for charitable giving. It brings the HODL ethos of Bitcoin to charitable giving, and means your bitcoin donation today could make an even bigger impact tomorrow. By donating bitcoin — an investment in the future of money — you’re investing in the future of clean drinking water for years to come.\n\ncharity: water will use Gemini’s crypto wallet to accept and HODL bitcoin donations. Our founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, have agreed to personally match the first 50 bitcoin donated to The Bitcoin Water Trust — a gift that could serve approximately 50,000 people globally with clean water today, but hopefully many more in the future. The funds of the trust will be held in bitcoin and the fund intends to use bitcoin in 2025 and beyond for the construction of its clean water projects across 20+ countries.\n\ncharity: water is relentlessly focused on ending the global water crisis by investing in clean water solutions to provide safe drinking water to those who most need it. Currently, 785 million people globally lack access to clean water, and charity: water has provided 12.7M people across 29 countries with this basic need. \n\nWhile they began accepting bitcoin donations in 2014, charity: water historically sold the asset to immediately fund construction of new projects. Through their Bitcoin Water Trust initiative, however, they plan to hold onto the asset as an investment, with the hopes of building even more projects and helping more people as bitcoin appreciates in value. \n\nWe’re thrilled to help a fellow mission-driven organization like charity: water accept bitcoin and maximize its humanitarian efforts. \n\nYou can learn more and donate at [charitywater.org/bitcoin](http://charitywater.org/bitcoin).\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2jKc38uqRm4R061PrTvN1Y","blogIntroduction":"We are excited to announce the acquisition of Shard X, a leading developer of secure multi-party computation (MPC) cryptographic technology.","datePublished":"Jun 09, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"gemini-enhances-speed-and-scale-of-asset-listings-transfers-and-usage-with","title":"Gemini Enhances Speed and Scale of Asset Listings, Transfers, and Usage With Shard X Acquisition","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

The addition of Shard X’s MPC will work in concert with all other aspects of Gemini’s custody offering, which includes role-based governance protocols, multiple layers of biometric access controls, and physical security to safeguard the sensitive key material, safely stored in government-rated hardware security modules (HSMs), that controls customers’ assets. \n\nShard X, which will become a part of Gemini’s UK affiliate, was founded in 2018 by Yaniv Neu-Ner, Nikita Lesnikov, and Navaho De Wet with the goal of making the crypto ecosystem more secure. Shard X’s MPC technology generates key fragments which are used in a  distributed signing protocol without ever reconstructing a full private key. The team has developed a portable MPC implementation that aims to run in high security environments, such as hardware security modules, ensuring the highest integrity and secure processing of private key fragments that protect digital assets.\n\nThe acquisition of Shard X is yet another step forward in providing our customers with the products and services they demand as we remain laser focused on our mission of empowering the individual through crypto.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler Winklevoss  \nChief Executive Officer","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"5xIGKQIIrfVAMaoD5iVOmc","blogIntroduction":"Dhruv and Jarol join Amiti Uttarwar as the first three Bitcoin Core Developers sponsored by the Gemini Opportunity Fund.","datePublished":"Jun 04, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"gemini-to-sponsor-bitcoin-core-developers-dhruv-mehta-and-jarol-rodriguez","title":"Gemini Sponsors Bitcoin Core Developers Dhruv Mehta and Jarol Rodriguez","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2yB0CDGKtXoO60ip5hLdUa","authorName":"Beth Kurteson","authorPosition":"Managing Director","intro":"Beth Kurteson is Gemini's Managing Director in the Office of the CEOs and joined in October 2019 after working with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss for many years.

They spoke about the Gemini Credit Card, for which Mastercard will be the [exclusive network partner](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-credit-card-to-launch-with-mastercard-as-network-partner), and the growth of consumer-first products that can help catapult crypto into the mainstream. \n\nNoah outlined how the Gemini Credit Card will expose a broad retail audience to crypto without changing their day-to-day behavior, allowing users to seamlessly earn crypto rewards on the dollars they spend. He added that more than half of those on the 250,000+ strong waitlist are not existing Gemini customers, suggesting that people are seeking risk-free exposure to crypto. The card rolls out this summer to U.S. residents in every state and will grant up to 3% back on purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted — [join the waitlist](https://www.gemini.com/credit-card/waitlist) for early access to the card. \n\nMoving from retail to the institutional front, our Global Head of Business Development, Dave Abner, dove into Gemini’s expansive institutional offering that includes custody, clearing, and trade execution services. He noted the central role education will play in broader institutional adoption, adding that he anticipates the crypto exchange traded product market alone will grow to $100 billion to $200 billion over the coming years. \n\nWith unified offerings — like [Gemini Fund Solutions](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-fund-solutions-a-unified-offering-for-fund-managers) — Dave explained how Gemini works alongside institutions seeking to harness novel opportunities in crypto that will continue to emerge over the next decade.

Here, we provide an in-depth walkthrough of the five main ways to do so: __Wire and Bank Transfers__, __ACH Transfer__, __Apple Pay and Google Pay__, __Debit Card Purchases__, and __Crypto Transfers__. \n\nYou can [download a PDF of these steps here](https://assets.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/uguI358a2I0MIEBnWmmSD/dc713dfc25174ae1d06e1efb0db6230f/Gemini_Product_Walkthrough_-_Funding_Crypto_Purchases.pdf).\n\n__Linking Your Bank Account__\n\nA critical first step to ensure successful Wire or Bank Transfers and ACH Transfers (U.S. only) is to [link your bank account](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005752603-How-do-I-add-my-Bank-Account-). You can link your bank account on both our Mobile App and Website.\n\n__Step 1 -__ Navigate to Settings through the Account drop down, and click the Payment Methods tab on the left sidebar. \n\n__Step 2 -__ Automatically link your bank account through Plaid using your bank username and password. Otherwise, manually link your bank account in the Payment Methods tab using your bank account and routing numbers (information required varies according to the currency your bank account uses). \n\nOnce you’ve successfully connected your bank account, the path is open for you to make Wire and Bank Transfers, as well as ACH transfers into your Gemini account.\n![Blog Inline 03](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6NjikZ3DzdLHZdqBx8G1oG/87208c48dc03f7b455a92a1085b1de34/Blog_Inline_03.png)\n\n### Wire and Bank Transfers\n\nUsing a wire or bank transfer to fund your Gemini account allows you to deposit unlimited funds and access them quickly (1-2 days, sometimes less). We support various types of transfers, including SWIFT wires for all currencies, SEPA for Euros, FPS and CHAPS for British Pounds, and FAST transfers for Singapore Dollars.\n\n__Step 1 - Prepare your wire or bank transfer.__ In the top right corner of your Gemini account page click Transfer and then Deposit into Gemini. On the next page choose which fiat currency to deposit, and select Wire or Bank Transfer as your Deposit Method — click continue. \n\n__Step 2 - Collect your transfer instructions.__ The next page will outline all the details you need to successfully complete a wire or bank transfer. You’ll also receive an email with instructions on how to complete the transfer. This will include a reference code you must include in your transfer details, as well as our receiving bank information and beneficiary account information.\n\n__Step 3 - Contact your bank and transfer your funds to Gemini.__ Make sure the name on your bank account matches the name on your Gemini account. Funds sent to your Gemini institutional or business account must also be from bank accounts in the name of the entity. Visit this page if you’re still having issues with your wire or bank transfer.\n\nWire transfers in the U.S. sent before 3:00 pm ET will typically be available in your Gemini account the same day or next business day. Other jurisdictions will have varied banking hours and holidays that will impact fund transfer cutoff times.\n![Blog Inline 03](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6NjikZ3DzdLHZdqBx8G1oG/87208c48dc03f7b455a92a1085b1de34/Blog_Inline_03.png)\n\n### ACH Transfers\n\n[ACH Transfers](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360032219551-How-do-I-send-in-a-Bank-Transfer-ACH-deposit-) are simpler than Wire and Bank Transfers, and your funds will be immediately available for trading. Keep in mind there are limits to how much you can transfer with ACH, and it can take up to 5 business days for your funds to settle and be available for withdrawal. ACH Transfers are only available in the U.S.\n\n__Step 1 - Prepare your ACH transfer.__ In the top right corner of your Gemini account page click Transfer and then Deposit into Gemini. On the next page choose which fiat currency to deposit, select Bank (ACH) Transfer as your Deposit Method, and choose your transfer source — click continue. \n\n__Step 2 - Enter your deposit amount.__\n\n__Step 3 - Review and complete your deposit.__\n![Blog Inline 03](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6NjikZ3DzdLHZdqBx8G1oG/87208c48dc03f7b455a92a1085b1de34/Blog_Inline_03.png)\n\n### Apple Pay and Google Pay\n\nWe recently launched Apple Pay and Google Pay support! We’ve outlined how to seamlessly buy crypto using these methods [here](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-apple-pay-and-google-pay). \n\n__Step 1 - Open the Gemini Mobile app and tap a crypto to purchase.__ (Download our app in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gemini-buy-sell-crypto/id1408914447) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gemini.android.app)).\n\n__Step 2 - Tap the Buy button.__ Next, select whether you’d like to purchase Once or schedule a Recurring buy. Next, enter the amount of crypto you’d like to buy.\n\n__Step 3 - The option to pay with Apple Pay or Google Pay will appear.__ Select the one you want to use and then tap Pay.\n![Blog Inline 03](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6NjikZ3DzdLHZdqBx8G1oG/87208c48dc03f7b455a92a1085b1de34/Blog_Inline_03.png)\n\n### Debit Card Purchases\n\n[Debit card purchases](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049611152-Can-I-Use-A-Debit-Card-To-Make-A-Purchase-On-The-Gemini-Exchange-) are quick and easy. Once we’ve verified your card you can immediately buy up to $1,000 in crypto on a daily basis directly through your debit card. \n\n__Step 1 -__ [__Link your Debit Card__](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057304011-How-to-add-a-Debit-Card-). Navigate to Settings through the Account drop down, and you’ll see a Payment Methods tab on the left sidebar. Follow the prompts to seamlessly add your debit card to your account. Make sure that all the information you include matches the information on your Gemini account. \n\n__Step 2 - Verify your Debit Card.__ There are two ways to verify your card. If you’re using the Gemini Mobile App you can verify your card by simply taking a picture of the front and back of your debit card. If you’re using our web interface, microdeposits will be made on your debit card account statement between $0.99 and $1.99 in value (or an equivalent in your local currency). You’ll be asked to confirm the amount that was charged to you, and once verified, the charges will be reversed.\n\n__Step 3 - Enter the magical world of crypto.__ Now that your debit card is added to your account and verified, you’ll be able to immediately make purchases directly from our exchange using your card!\n\nNote that there is a 3.49% fee added to your purchase, and you must link a bank account to withdraw your funds — you cannot withdraw directly to your debit card. \n![Blog Inline 03](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6NjikZ3DzdLHZdqBx8G1oG/87208c48dc03f7b455a92a1085b1de34/Blog_Inline_03.png)\n\n### Crypto Deposits\n\nYou can [deposit crypto](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/209113666-How-do-I-deposit-digital-assets-into-my-Gemini-Account-) from an external wallet for trading on Gemini in a few simple steps. \n\n__Step 1 - Prepare your crypto deposit.__ In the top right corner of your Gemini account page click Transfer and then Deposit into Gemini. Select the crypto you’d like to transfer into Gemini from the dropdown menu, and select the unique deposit address we’ve generated for you. \n\n__Step 2 - Instruct your external wallet to initiate the transfer.__ With your unique deposit address in hand, visit your external wallet or service provider custodying your crypto and initiate the crypto transfer to the deposit address. \n\n__Step 3 - See your crypto deposited into your Gemini account for immediate trading.__\n\nWe will continue to provide you with more ways to access the growing crypto ecosystem and support your financial future.

In keeping with Gemini’s mission of empowering the individual through crypto, our series __Women in Crypto__ seeks to shed light on the amazing work that women are doing in crypto and blockchain, with the hope of inspiring more women around the world to invest in crypto and seek jobs in the industry. *  \n\n*Today we are featuring __Karen Chang__, VP of Engineering at Stellar Development Foundation. Karen has over 25 years of experience as a software engineer and in engineering management at companies like Netscape, Goldman Sachs, Netflix and Salesforce.*\n\n*Learn more about Stellar [here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/stellar-blockchain-payments-xlm-coin) on [Cryptopedia](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia). *\n\n__Tell us about your crypto \"lightbulb\" moment. How did you get into crypto?__\n\nI was working at Goldman Sachs in NYC throughout the 2000s and had lived through the financial crisis and recession in 2008. Most of my friends didn’t work in banks, and I experienced the strong backlash against Wall Street that came after the government bailout. The perception was that financial services companies were taking high risk bets in financial engineering of debt instruments, and because of the contagion effect of the real estate bubble popping, a small pool of participants were able to destabilize the entire global economy.\n\nWind forward several years, I had come back to SF and was working in tech. I hadn’t been following bitcoin closely until I got into a conversation with an acquaintance who was a true believer in bitcoin and heavily invested. I’ll admit that at the time, I thought of cryptocurrencies as heavy on hype, even though I knew blockchains had some novel uses as a new type of distributed system. Out of that debate, I started reading up on the space, connecting the dots between my past experience during and after the financial crisis and this idea of decentralization in finance — the value of open loop financial systems, protocols, and the runway that creates true marketplaces for financial innovation, low-cost access, and experimentation.\n\nThen, the Stellar Development Foundation reached out. I talked to Jed and Denelle about Vibrant, an app being built in the Stellar ecosystem to allow cross border conversion of currencies, targeted at South American countries like Argentina, where devaluation has been a real and present danger. That use case really resonated with me as an applied benefit of DeFi and cryptocurrencies, and tied into my personal experience in finance and technology in a way that felt meaningful.\n\n__Tell us about your role as VP of Engineering — how would you describe your day-to-day role at the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF)?__ \n\nMy day-to-day role involves managing our engineering teams, and being responsible for delivering our Stellar SDKs and APIs, full stack product, partner engagement, and infrastructure. I’m focused on making sure our work is aligned with our overall SDF goals in becoming the premier cross-border payment network, and that we’ve got the right talent and organizational competencies to deliver on that.\n\nI spend a lot of time recruiting, talking to my peers in business development, understanding the business context, and translating that into engineering goals. I see a lot of what I do through the lens of organizational readiness — making sure we’re covering the short-term product milestones, while keeping an eye on the overall scale, security, and health of the Stellar network and providing the right tools to our ecosystem of developers so we can make sure Stellar is easy to use.\n\n__What's the one piece of professional advice that you would give to your younger self that would have helped you the most as you progressed in your career?__\n\nI think for a long time I thought of communicating as a way to express myself. It wasn’t until I got a little older and wiser that I realized self-expression was secondary to delivering a message. And to do that effectively, I needed to build competency around perspective-taking and being able to communicate so that the other person was able to receive the message. In any collaborative environment, I would say the ability to influence your peers and other people is probably one of the most valuable skills you have in your repertoire. \n\n__How can we encourage and facilitate more women entering the crypto workforce, especially in technical functions like engineering? __\n\nI think we need to reduce some of the noise in crypto that can be distracting or intimidating for newcomers. I find the barrier to entry is similar to finance. We like to use obfuscating words or acronyms for concepts that could be more simply explained in plain English. \nEveryone understands money, right? We all use it, borrow it, exchange it, and we need a place to record what we do with it. Let’s make this space less intimidating by simplifying our words.\n\nThe challenge we face hiring in crypto is similar to what I encountered in the mid-90s working at Netscape. At that time, it’s not like there was a computer science degree in internet protocols, so you needed to look beyond a tick-the-boxes approach to find talent. Instead, you prioritize fundamentals and translatable skills that enable people to ramp up in a new industry. Here at SDF, we have folks with astronomy, physics, and law degrees. Some who didn’t go to college at all.  \n\nI think certain companies in Silicon Valley have created a culture of perceived academic barriers that have nothing to do with the applied problem solving skills needed for any given role. \n\nThat speaks to the second part of my answer to how we bring more women in crypto. I think it’s incumbent on us to find female talent in adjacent domains who are good at logic, are passionate about the interdisciplinary nature of crypto (policy, compliance, engineering, finance), and who show they have the personal grit and conscientiousness to continuously learn in a fast-moving domain of knowledge. I love growing female engineers who can show that kind of trajectory because they will always win the race.\n\n__Who are some women that you admire in the crypto space? In tech? In general?__\n\nI don’t say this to be self-serving but I really admire our CEO \u0026 Executive Director, Denelle Dixon. She was a major reason that I took the leap and joined SDF. She leads with intention and clarity of purpose. With her roots in the web and her vast legal experience, she brings a balance of expertise and leadership. I feel fortunate to work with and learn from her. \n\nMore broadly in the tech sector, I’m a big fan of Megan Smith, the former CTO of the Obama administration. She’s been a tech pioneer in the public and private sectors, leading engineering teams at some of the most influential players in the world. And throughout it all, she has stayed true to her beliefs of inclusive innovation.  \n\nIn general, I’m an admirer of Stacey Abrams and the work she has done in Georgia to expand voting access and rights and how that has spurred not only national discussion but action. She is a vital voice in the United States for equality and for me, an inspiration.\n\n__Why do you believe in crypto?__\n\nI think blockchain technologies open up the space for financial innovation to enable truly efficient markets. I think this spans not just financial instruments, like the payments space where Stellar plays a key role in reducing the cost of transaction for cross-border assets, but also in really any domain in which there are buyers, sellers, and financial records and contracts.\n\n__What is something unique that you have learned from working in crypto?__\n\nThe main thing I learned in crypto so far is just how many of the use cases require us to solve problems having to do with liquidity. That’s a departure from where I’ve been before — I’m used to highly liquid markets like security assets! It’s not a problem I’ve had to think about too much, let alone think about solving! But price discovery, slippage, and spread problems having to do with new markets for currency pairs in the payment corridors Stellar creates is something we think about quite a bit and a fascinating new topic for me to learn about.

It’s not forced on us by a government or some other central authority, it’s chosen by us, for us — by the people, for the people. Wow.\n\nFor many, the idea of emergent money that is not mandated by fiat is hard to grok. We’re used to being told what money is. For most of our lives, paternalistic money is all we’ve ever known...until Bitcoin.\n\nDogecoin continues Bitcoin’s tradition of giving the control of money back to the people. Yes, it’s a meme coin, but all money is a meme. And all money is both an idea and a matter of faith or belief in it. Over the multi-milennia history of money, the majority of money (be it shells, beads, precious metals, etc.) has been what we the people say it is and believe it is.\n\nDogecoin is the perfect vehicle to lay bare this fundamental truth about money. And in serving this purpose, DOGE has a legitimate claim to some value. It reflects the true history and nature of money. It turns the idea of money being something that’s issued by an authority — a conceit — on its head. They say there’s some truth in every joke. Dogecoin’s value is its punchline. \n\nDogecoin is as much a statement as it is a currency. A statement about the philosophy of money. The democratization of money. It’s a protest against the fact that fiat money and the centralized financial system are not level playing fields. That they are built by a few and disproportionately favor those few. That too much power rests in too few hands.\n\nAnd the world is waking up to this. Nothing captured this more than the GameStop saga. We saw first-hand how the system is rigged against the individual investor and we can’t unsee this. We saw how the individual investor can be more sophisticated than the most sophisticated institutional investors. Most importantly, we saw that the individual investor is ready to demand better. We don’t believe it's a coincidence that global interest in crypto and Dogecoin spiked after individual investors were GameStopped.\n\nNo one person, organization, or authority decides the value of a crypto – its value is determined by its supply and your demand for it. In Dogecoin’s case, its money supply is __transparent__, __predictable__, and __disinflationary__. The Dogecoin protocol issues a fixed amount of 5 billion DOGE every year. Over time, this fixed, annual issuance of 5 billion DOGE will represent a much smaller percentage of Dogecoin’s overall money supply. This means the growth rate of Dogecoin’s money supply is actually decreasing. In other words, Dogecoin’s money supply is disinflationary. This is not dissimilar to how [Ethereum](https://www.gemini.com/prices/ether)’s money supply of ether currently works. Recently, demand for Dogecoin has oustripped its supply. As a result, its price has been mooning. The people are speaking.\n\nAs the world ponders the popularity and meme-ification of a grammatically challenged dog, many are engaging in a referendum on centralized money and finance by joining the Dogecoin community. And the best part? They’re doing it with a smile. So amaze.\n\nWe’re not here to tell you what money is. We’ll leave that up to you. We’re here to empower you with __greater choice, independence, and opportunity__.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTyler Winklevoss  \nChief Executive Officer\n\n*Updated: May 5, 2021*","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"3U8LSbXO44VRJ7EyL79FSs","blogIntroduction":"Trading and custody are now available for CUBE, BOND, INJ, LPT, MATIC, and SUSHI.","datePublished":"Apr 28, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"gemini-supports-new-defi-metaverse-data-storage-and-infrastructure-tokens","title":"Gemini Supports New DeFi, Metaverse, Data Storage, and Infrastructure Tokens","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"5L04wrDyKQjLzjXKLj8usU","alt":"Blog Header - #zeta","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5L04wrDyKQjLzjXKLj8usU/f85c095ee04c2b313de45c1cd2344284/Blog_Header_-_-zeta.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"We are delighted to support a new set of DeFi, metaverse, data storage, video streaming, and infrastructure tokens.

BarnBridge is a tokenized risk protocol that allows users to hedge against yield sensitivity and price volatility. It does so by accessing debt pools on other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and creating multiple assets within a single debt pool with varying risk/return characteristics. The platform offers investments in senior and junior tranches, where senior tranche investors receive fixed interest payments and the remaining proceeds go to junior investors who can max out at higher interest rates but don’t have guaranteed payouts.

The SushiSwap platform is an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that employs an [automated market-maker (AMM)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Automated%20Market%20Maker%20(AMM)) rather than a typical order-book to create a market. Rather than match individual buy and sell orders, SushiSwap users pool two assets providing increased liquidity for trading pairs (i.e., ETH/SUSHI). SushiSwap launched as a fork of [Uniswap](https://www.gemini.com/prices/uniswap), but has developed into a more diversified, grassroots platform. You can see the [SUSHI price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/sushiswap) and more information by following the link.\n\n![Blog Inline inj](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/25HvJf5QC1vYGrYQPEO3aZ/955dd50778515d1afaeedb4d1829bcd3/Blog_Inline_inj.png)\n\n__Injective Protocol (INJ)__\n\nINJ is an ERC-20 utility token that has a variety of use cases on the Injective Protocol, which includes providing market making incentives, governance, and block validator rewards. Injective Protocol is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for perpetual swaps, futures, margin, and spot trading. Unlike other DEXes (e.g. UniSwap, SushiSwap), Injective Protocol is not an automated market maker (AMM), relying instead on order book relayers (also known as order matchers) to manage liquidity. The protocol also supports generalized smart contract execution through a modular implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of the Cosmos-SDK (based on Ethermint). Injective Protocol aims to decentralize crypto trading and solve issues stemming from order collusion and front-running. You can see the [INJ price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/injective) and more information by following the link.\n\n__Metaverse Tokens:__\n\n![Blog Inline cube](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2rq0ztH66x2GbxXgAMHGLh/fdde92cbb56a43d522dbc280445eefe8/Blog_Inline_cube.png)\n\n__Somnium Space (CUBE)__\n\nCUBE is an ERC-20 token native to the Somnium Space ecosystem. CUBE can be used to purchase virtual assets, pay for goods and services in the metaverse (i.e., rent land, pay for games and events), as well as reward players with good “Karma.” Somnium Space is a Virtual Reality world on the Ethereum blockchain (or metaverse), where players can buy land, build or import NFTs, explore, and trade. Participants can instantly join from any device via Somnium WEB client or download the Somnium application locally on their computer to immerse themselves into persistent worlds via virtual reality (VR) headsets like Oculus, HTC, VIVE, HP, and others.

Polygon (formerly known as the Matic Network) is a Layer-2 solution on the Ethereum network. It provides scalable, secure, and instant transactions using sidechains. Based on an adapted implementation of the Plasma framework, Polygon optimizes for asset security and employs a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators. Decentralized application (DApp) developers can leverage the Polygon network for its fast transaction speed and low transaction cost. You can see the [MATIC price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/polygon) and more information by following the link.\n\n__Data Storage Tokens:__\n\n![Blog Inline ocean](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/3IbAaSvqmA0jA5yxsIH6Wo/e14cceea7f84e67804a4600727318e04/Blog_Inline_ocean.png)\n\n__Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) __\n\nOCEAN is an ERC-20 payment token and serves as the Ocean Protocol’s native token. The Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange protocol that aims to make data and services universally available for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and more. Data consumers spend OCEAN tokens to access datasets and run AI and machine learning (ML) models via marketplaces. Data providers earn OCEAN tokens for delivering data and services to the network. Token holders can participate in the Ocean Protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance where 1 OCEAN token is worth 1 vote. The OCEAN DAO, however, is non-binding as the Ocean Foundation has the final say on whether to implement changes to the protocol. You can see the [OCEAN price](https://www.gemini.com/prices/ocean) and more information by following the link.\n\n__Video Streaming Tokens:__\n\n![Blog Inline lpt](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6r6nBFYWzwVGAFQTeeMAVr/3d032931f6837eede4751567fdf6af1e/Blog_Inline_lpt.png)\n\n__Livepeer (LPT)__\n\nLPT is an ERC-20 token and serves as the protocol token on the Livepeer network. Participants who want to perform validation work on the Livepeer network must stake LPT. Livepeer is a decentralized video streaming network built on the Ethereum blockchain and aims to decentralize live video broadcasts over the internet. Its Livepeer Media Server (LPMS) product offering is an open-source implementation of a media server that provides all of the features necessary for decentralized application (dApp) developers and existing broadcasters to build live video functionality into their applications.

More than two-thirds (77%) of U.S. adults are interested in learning about cryptocurrency and more women than men identify as crypto-curious.\n\nOur data also shows that as cryptocurrency continues to gain more mainstream acceptance, crypto is seen as a long-term investment. The large majority of current crypto owners report buying and holding crypto for its long-term investment potential rather than actively buying and selling as a means to achieve profits or using it to make purchases on the internet.\n\nOther notable results from the survey include:\n\n__- The number of crypto investors is set to nearly double this year,__ with 13% of those curious about investing planning to purchase crypto in the next 12 months.\n\n__- For the first time ever, more women than men are interested in getting into crypto soon.__ Women make up 53% of crypto-curious people interested in investing in the asset class.\n\n__- Education is crucial in initiating or increasing engagement with crypto. __Of those who are crypto-curious, 60% identify as “not very” or “not at all” knowledgeable, setting the stage for education to play a significant role in crypto adoption.\n\n__- The next wave of crypto buyers are older and have slightly smaller yearly incomes,__ with an average age of 44 and average household income of $107,000 a year.\n\nThe 2021 U.S. State of Crypto Report offers a promising look at the future growth and adoption of this revolutionary asset class, further supporting Gemini’s mission of empowering the individual through crypto.

Digital artists, who could otherwise never participate in selling their art like artists in the traditional art world, can now do so. This is not just a watershed moment, it is an entirely new paradigm. It allows digital creators to not only make a living like offline creators, but it has brought in a whole new generation of collectors who’s interest and passion for the space will help propel it forward. It gives us great pride at Nifty Gateway to see so many digital creators thrive in this new medium, especially in the backdrop of the pandemic. Our overarching mission is to empower creators through crypto and we won’t rest until 1 billion people are collecting NFTs.\n\n## Environmental Concerns\n\nThat being said, we acknowledge the growing concern from some regarding the carbon footprint of the NFT movement. Ironically, because blockchains give the world such a transparent and accurate accounting of the energy consumption of our industry, they provide a tangible number to focus and dwell on, which has led to a double standard being applied to our industry. Because there is no blockchain to account for the carbon footprint of the traditional art world, which includes, *inter alia*, all of the private and commercial air travel to the Basels, Biennales, and countless other festivals around the world, not to mention the automobile traffic to gallery exhibitions, museums, and so forth, such criticism has not been leveled against the offline art world, despite the fact that its carbon footprint is orders of magnitude greater. Apparently, this is the price of transparency and accountability. Nonetheless, the good news is that the carbon footprint of the NFT industry is small when you take [an honest look at all the contributing factors to climate change](https://sterlingcrispin.blogspot.com/2021/02/crypto-art-sky-is-not-falling.html). The better news is that *__Nifty Gateway is committing to become a carbon negative platform__*. \n\n## Becoming Carbon Negative\n\nOur plan is to calculate our emissions using the following [site](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/cryptoart-footprint), which will allow us to estimate our total carbon footprint over time. At the end of every month, we will purchase offsets for 2x the amount of carbon footprint Nifty Gateway created from blockchain transactions that month, and thereby in theory Nifty Gateway will become a net remover of carbon.\n\nIn addition to buying offsets, we are already building a new NFT minting system that will be significantly greener. To be clear, trading NFTs and storing NFTs on Nifty Gateway __*does not*__ affect Nifty Gateway’s carbon footprint. This is because these actions happen on our internal ledger, which means they are *off-blockchain* transactions. However, when we mint a creator’s NFT and put it on the blockchain, this is an *on-blockchain* transaction and does increase Nifty Gateway's carbon footprint. To that end, we have been developing a new minting system that will utilize [EIP 2309](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309) and make our minting process approximately 99% more efficient. We are already hard at work and look forward to deploying our new minting system in the weeks ahead. Once launched, Nifty Gateway will have a materially smaller carbon footprint and need to purchase even less offsets to remain carbon negative.\n\nBut that’s not all. Recently, we helped raise $6.5 million dollars for [Open Earth Foundation](https://www.openfoundation.earth/) via [The Carbon Drop](https://niftygateway.com/collections/carbondrop). All of the proceeds of this drop will go towards the development of blockchain technology for climate accountability. We’re going to continue to look for ways like this in which Nifty Gateway can have an even greater impact on our community and the world around us.\n\n## Ethereum 2.0\n\nNifty Gateway is built on top of the Ethereum network where much of the NFT phenomenon is unfolding. But to put things in perspective, only 1% of all transactions on the Ethereum network are related to interactions with NFT contracts. And the entire Ethereum network itself only accounts for .02% of the world’s total carbon footprint. That being said, the Ethereum community has never been one to settle. In fact, it has already been working towards becoming more sustainable since well before the recent mainstream interest in NFTs. For years it has been planning Ethereum 2.0, which uses a zero carbon consensus mechanism known as Proof of Stake, and this past December it already started migrating to Ethereum 2.0. \n\nThe Nifty Gateway team appreciates the passionate and diverse voices of our community and we look forward to continuing to build this magical new frontier of art and collectibles together. Here’s to the exciting days ahead.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nDuncan \u0026 Griffin Cock Foster  \nNifty Gateway, Co-Founders\n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"61HeiaY1OSmJmR0LeRaxMN","blogIntroduction":"With Gemini Earn, you can earn up to 7.4% APY on your crypto held at Gemini.","datePublished":"Mar 25, 2021","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"over-usd1-billion-earning-interest-in-gemini-earn","title":"Over $1 Billion Earning Interest in Gemini Earn","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"XE8oqlTL6ZstDDsH7g0x3","alt":"Blog Header - #gemini1B","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/XE8oqlTL6ZstDDsH7g0x3/d3663fb0cf4f999d02bc8968ae0a14e8/Blog_Header_-_-gemini1B.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"We are pleased to announce that Gemini customers are now collectively earning interest on __more than $1 billion in loans originated through Gemini Earn__.

How did you get into crypto?__\n\nI've heard about cryptocurrencies a lot since 2011. At some point around 2012 or 2013, I started looking into it for myself and liked the irreverence at the heart of it. \n\n__What was the inspiration behind Tezos, and what do you hope for its future?__\n\nAround 2013, most technologies that could theoretically improve Bitcoin were realized through the launches of new cryptocurrencies. Tezos was proposed in 2014 as a cryptocurrency that allows its owners to upgrade the codebase seamlessly while preserving network effects. \n\nSince its launch in 2018, the Tezos blockchain has upgraded seamlessly more than any other public chain. I would like to see more provocative upgrades to the network in the coming years. \n\n__What's the one piece of professional advice that you would give to your younger self that would have helped you the most as you progressed in your career?__\n\nDitch the losers, double-down on the winners. I have wasted time trying to fix broken things rather than improve upon what was going well.\n\n__How can we encourage and facilitate more women entering the crypto workforce?__\n\nThe culture of the space has created a filter such that women who tend to stick around are either hard-nosed or smart enough not to look at comments sections.\n\nCandidly, a great part about cryptocurrencies is that you don't have to work on them to enjoy their benefits. I would rather that more women own cryptocurrencies en masse than work in the industry.\n\n__Who are some women that you admire in the crypto space? In tech? In general?__\n\nIn the cryptocurrency space, I admire the contributions of Dahlia Malkhi, Dawn Song, and Cathie Wood. In technology, I admire Judy Estrin, Fei-Fei Li, and Ruth Porat. More generally, I think Janelle Monae, Pat McGrath, Roz Brewer, Aileen Lee, and Taylor Swift are total badasses worth emulating. \n\n__Why do you believe in crypto?__\n\nIt solves a problem that people have largely proposed hackish solutions around for centuries: moving value across the world without the use of an intermediary. I don't think it makes sense to bet against novel solutions to old problems. \n\n__What is something unique that you have learned from working in crypto?__\n\nPeople really don't like thinking about finance. It is astounding what passes for thought leadership.\n\n__How do you see blockchain evolving over the next five years?__\n\nI like the burgeoning NFT collectibles market, no matter how noisy it is, because it gets to the heart of what cryptocurrencies should do in other industries by creating a viable alternative to traditional intermediaries. Right now, creative types are realizing this as a new way to monetize their work. In the coming years, I hope everyone can use decentralized solutions that typically fall into categories like financial services.\n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"3PBam30sQdOd3EOXWnfNjl","blogIntroduction":"We want to back the next generation of founders and projects by providing them with capital as well as our industry knowledge and expertise.","datePublished":"Mar 23, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"introducing-the-gemini-frontier-fund-betting-on-the-future-of-crypto","title":"Introducing the Gemini Frontier Fund: Betting on the Future of Crypto","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"},{"id":"1L6GZwR7UXatMqgSIlxiCP","type":"Innovation"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"4Po5P3ICaLZdLxamwGN60c","alt":"Blog Header - #geminifund","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4Po5P3ICaLZdLxamwGN60c/7448639bf36dfeb9f7a06042be7be087/Blog_Header_-_-geminifund.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"Today, we are proud to introduce the Gemini Frontier Fund, a strategic venture fund focused on investing in early-stage crypto projects and startups. \n\nWe realize that to ensure the continued expansion, increased adoption, and greater success of the crypto ecosystem, we need to support entrepreneurs as they develop, build, and experiment on the magical frontier of crypto.

To be clear, the Nifty Gateway platform remains secure. We would, however, like to use this moment as an opportunity to raise awareness about ATOs within the NFT community. \n\nThe following guidance highlights the steps members of our community can take to protect their accounts and shares some of the security features we’ve deployed on Nifty Gateway. \n\n__How exactly do ATOs of online accounts occur?__ \n\nAn ATO occurs when an attacker obtains a user's valid email and password, often by breaching other unrelated services and then trying the same email and password combination across a variety of sites, including Nifty Gateway. Therefore, it is important to practice good security hygiene by *__never__* reusing the same password for more than one service. This means that the password you use for Nifty Gateway should be unique and not used for any other service.\n\n__How can you prevent ATOs?__\n\nIn addition to never reusing a password, you should *__always__* enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on Nifty Gateway and any other service you use. Our customers can reference our website for instructions on how to [enable two-factor authentication](https://help.niftygateway.com/2020/08/05/guide-to-two-factor-authentication-on-nifty-gateway/). \n\nWe have also deployed improvements to our platform to further mitigate similar attacks. The most impactful change we made is prompting users to perform email verification before performing sensitive account actions.\n\nIn the coming weeks and months, the team plans to roll out further enhancements to help mitigate the impact of ATOs. This includes mandatory 2FA for high risk accounts, additional controls to mitigate potential misuse, and continued focus on raising awareness around account security in the NFT community.\n\nWe also recommend users avoid negotiating trades outside of the official Nifty Gateway marketplace. Transactions occurring off-platform present significant counterparty risk and lack the security controls offered by the Nifty Gateway marketplace.\n\nOur goal is to help educate all our users and engage our community wherever you may be on your security journey. We will continue to increase awareness of security best practices, including the risks of password reuse, and the importance of 2FA to the Nifty Gateway community. Coupled with the new controls that are planned, we’re excited to continue to make the platform even stronger for all our users. \n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nDuncan and Griffin Cock Foster  \nNifty Gateway Co-Founders","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2jXNSIkJ44GMrb7oZQlxo","blogIntroduction":"Gemini sponsors the historic Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.","datePublished":"Mar 09, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"introducing-the-gemini-boat-race-2021","title":"Introducing The Gemini Boat Race 2021","blogAuthors":[{"id":"6wThwfXl28hyj9OzBSgzs8","authorName":"Tyler and Cameron","authorPosition":"CEO and President ","intro":"Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are Co-founders of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and earn cryptocurrency such as bitcoin and ether.

The £75,000 Bursary will provide rowing instruction and education to disadvantaged students by removing the financial barriers that often prevent them from taking part.\n\nThis is a special alliance for our company and for us personally, having competed in the 2010 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race in the Oxford Blue Boat and the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. \n\nWe started rowing at the Saugatuck Rowing Club in 1997 when we met James Mangan, an Irishman who founded the club in 1990. Back then, James would show us VHS tapes of the Oxford-Cambridge race and we dreamed of one day competing at that level.\n\nRowing was our first foray into entrepreneurship, inspiring us to create the varsity rowing team at our high school. Our experience in rowing taught us that whether you are building yourself as an athlete or building a startup, the power of big dreams together with conviction and perseverance cannot be underestimated. This potent combination led us to row at Harvard, Oxford, the Olympics, and ultimately start Gemini, which today has over 350 employees worldwide.\n\nRowing instilled in us the power of aligning a team with shared principles and values for the purposes of advancing a common mission. At Gemini, we strive to move at the speed of innovation, with as much agility and velocity as possible. We are constantly in search of “swing,” that state of flow when everyone is rowing together or working together in harmony. It’s that powerful and rhythmic force that drives a rowing shell or startup towards its objective as fast, efficiently, and joyously as possible.\n\nOur mission — to empower the individual through crypto — starts with providing you with a safe and secure platform to buy, sell, store, and earn on your crypto.

The results further remind us that there is huge potential for the industry to educate investors, with 38.7% of respondents saying they either do not know anything at all about crypto, or do not know enough to invest.\n\nMomentum is growing in the crypto industry across the globe and all walks of life, with consumer interest supported by the proliferation of easy, safe, and secure platforms on which to invest.

It’s nearly impossible to avoid, and challenging to detect and mitigate. We wanted to share a few details around a recent occurrence at Gemini that highlights the opaque nature of third-party risk and underscores the importance of cross-team and cross-company collaboration.\n\nWhat is third-party risk? Simply put, it is the additional attack surface created by the use of software and services not owned by your company. Does your code include dependencies that your developers didn't write? That's third-party risk. How many SaaS products do your HR and recruiting teams use? That's third-party risk.\n\nThird-party risk is often seen as just a part of doing business, because it is. You would be hard-pressed to find companies that build their own custom recruiting software purely for internal use. That's because integrating third-party products, despite the cost of the service and increased risk, still outweighs the time, money, and effort required to create and maintain the \"wheel\" you've just reinvented.\n\nSo, if third-party risk is a necessary evil in order to do business in 2021, how do you get a handle on it? At Gemini, we determine the inherent risk of third-party service providers and group them into tiers based on our Procurement and Vendor Management Policy. Gemini assesses certain tiers of vendors through a risk assessment process that may include review of relevant certification documents, questionnaires, and technical reports. The ultimate goal is to understand any potential risks and if or how they can be mitigated.\n\nDetecting actual threats and truly understanding risk can be challenging. As we will explain, sometimes when it comes to third-party risk, more than three are invited to the party. Here we discuss how Gemini collaborated with multiple internal and external parties to detect, identify, and quickly resolve a recent issue.\n\n__Detecting and Assessing the Threat__\n\nIt started with a bug report that came in through our private bug bounty program. In the submission, the researcher reported they had found a “[Blind XSS](https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-1-6-33)” that disclosed a Zendesk administrator’s Authorization token.\n\nAs we began triaging the report, we noticed several interesting details:\n\n- The proof of concept provided by the researcher did not include a cross-site scripting ([XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)) payload, just an HTML *img* tag with a [Burp Collaborator](https://portswigger.net/blog/introducing-burp-collaborator) URL as the *src* attribute.\n- The [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) would prevent the user viewing the payload from sending the Authorization header in the request to fetch the image.\n- The User-Agent in the request was ‘python-requests/2.22.0’. \n\nWe quickly realized that this wasn’t a blind XSS, it was a [blind SSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/ssrf/blind)! We attempted to reproduce the issue following the steps provided by the researcher but were initially unsuccessful.\n\nWe contacted the researcher and worked closely with them while we continued attempting to reproduce the issue. Internally, we notified our Threat Detection and Response (TDR) team to help coordinate communication and attempt to determine if the issue had been exploited by any malicious parties. The Customer Support (CS) team was also notified to provide expertise and administrative access to our Zendesk account.\n\nAbout 30 minutes after initially attempting to reproduce the issue we received a response from our earlier testing. Sure enough it contained what appeared to be an Authorization token. The good news was that we were able to reproduce the reported issue, but why was there such a long delay? \n\n__Working With External Partners__\n\nAfter determining that the token contained in the response was a Zendesk OAuth token we quickly disabled it — just in case the token had been accessed by anyone other than the researcher we were working with. We were also able to identify the owner of the token; a Zendesk integration partner. Our CS team explained that they use this integration to help track their performance within Zendesk.\n\nOut of an abundance of caution, we immediately disabled the Zendesk partner integration and contacted the partner’s security team. The team promptly responded and quickly set a time to meet and discuss the details. We had a productive and efficient call, and within hours a fix had been rolled out. We also continued to communicate with the researcher who originally reported the issue. \n\n__Due Diligence and Root Cause Analysis__\n\nOnce the fix was in place, we took a step back to better understand the issue. Based on discussions with the partner’s security team, our CS team, and a bit of research, we learned exactly how the issue presented itself. To put it succinctly, it was a flaw in a third-party integration to a third-party service used by Gemini.\n\nEvery 30 minutes or so, the service would authenticate to Gemini’s Zendesk instance to read and parse any new support tickets. During the parsing process, the service would fetch URLs, images and other assets that appeared in the ticket. The problem was, the “Authorization” header was set for not only authenticated assets, but anything that required an HTTP request, such as an image. As a result, an attacker could obtain the token by creating a support ticket with an image hosted on a server they controlled. When the service attempted to fetch the image from the attacker-controlled server, it would set the HTTP Authorization header with the Authorization token, which the attacker could capture in their web server logs.\n\nWe continued to work closely with the partner’s security team as well as Zendesk in order to determine the entire scope of the leak. We obtained logs from multiple sources both external and internal. We also worked closely with our TDR and CS teams to determine how the access token was used and if any customer data was exposed. We were able to determine conclusively that the issue had not been exploited by anyone except for the researcher who originally notified us. At this point, we were comfortable re-enabling the Zendesk partner integration so our CS team could continue to use the service. \n\nThird-party risk will often present itself in unexpected ways. It is not feasible to attempt to mitigate every eventuality. Be prepared for the unexpected, rely on your internal teams, hope for the best with external partners, and “reduce the blast radius” whenever possible.\n\nWhile the root cause of this issue was not technically complicated, the multiple degrees of separation and the number of internal and external teams involved made for a challenging triage and response process. Despite this challenge, and with the help of some truly excellent external partners, this issue came to an efficient and safe conclusion.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nGemini Product Security Team\n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2enB5xenAHuE2lUYURpP96","blogIntroduction":"Here we address some of the most common issues raised to our customer support team, and how you can avoid them.","datePublished":"Feb 04, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-is-dedicated-to-an-exceptional-customer-experience","title":"Gemini Is Dedicated to an Exceptional Customer Experience","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"5thQ3l7wMyK3ME7Y6dggQW","alt":"2020-02-01 CustomerSupport","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5thQ3l7wMyK3ME7Y6dggQW/15999d59ac5c69820cc38c3348de399a/2020-02-01_CustomerSupport.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"Being accessible to our users and prompt with our responses to customer support requests is a top priority at Gemini. __Recently, our customer support wait times have been far too long for some users. We are acutely aware of this issue, and are working tirelessly to reduce wait times.__ \n\nFollowing the launch of [Gemini Earn](https://www.gemini.com/earn?utm_source=communications\u0026utm_medium=blog\u0026utm_campaign=gemini_earn) and the growing interest in cryptocurrency, we wanted to speak directly to our new and existing users about some of the most common concerns raised to our customer support team and give you some tips for how to make your experience with us as seamless as possible.\n\n__1. Delays withdrawing funds from Gemini__\n\n  [Delays when withdrawing funds](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005752503-Why-can-t-I-withdraw-my-digital-assets-) are most often caused by pending bank transfers (ACH), debit card transfers, or a delay in the onboarding process. \n\n  - __ACH__: When you deposit funds using an ACH bank transfer, the funds can take up to five days to settle, and while we immediately give you up to $500 to trade with, if your funds are in the process of settling you won't be able to withdraw from your account. \n  - __Debit Card Transfers__: When you place a buy order using a debit card, a two to three day hold is placed on your account while your funds are in transit, and you won’t be able to withdraw funds during that period.\n  - __Onboarding__: Likewise, if your account is not fully verified, you will not be able to withdraw funds until your registration is complete. Some of the reasons why your account verification may be delayed are highlighted next. \n\n__2. Delays opening a Gemini account__\n\n  Ensuring that we comply with applicable state and federal laws is a pillar of Gemini’s business, and we take every precaution when onboarding new customers. While some users are auto-onboarded, there are times when we need to take a closer look at your application and the documentation you send us. \n\n  When [sending us your information](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001318986-What-documents-are-required-for-your-verification-), make sure your ID image is clear, and that all the information you input matches your documents (e.g., the name entered on the registration page must match the name on your Photo ID exactly). If there are issues, we might need to get in touch and that could delay verification of your account.\n\n__3. Issues with wire transfers__\n\n  The first step to ensure a successful [wire transfer to your Gemini account](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005759166-When-will-my-wire-transfer-clear-) is to link your bank account to your Gemini account before you initiate the transfer. We won’t be able to accept the transfer until you’ve associated your bank account with your Gemini account. \n\n  Make sure the name on the bank account matches the name on your Gemini account. We can only accept funds in your name to your personal Gemini account. We can also only accept funds to your Gemini institutional or business account in the name of the entity. If you want to expedite your transfer, include your “Account Reference Code” in the memo or notes section of your wire. \n\nIf you have specific questions about Gemini Earn, we welcome you to visit our [Earn FAQ page](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/sections/360012099072-Earn). \n\nFor any additional questions, feel free to reach out to our customer support team by submitting a request via our [help center](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us).

You can display nifties you purchase on your profile, withdraw them to an external wallet, or deposit nifties from an external wallet into your Nifty Gateway account. \n\nAs Nifty Gateway enters its first full year, here are some of our highlights from 2020:\n\n- __$4.2 million+__ (largest single drop, by artist Beeple)\n- __$11 million+__ (total value of nifties sold between March and December 2020)\n- __$1.4 million+__ (value of a collaboration drop between artists Pak and Trevor Jones)\n- __$777,777__ (largest single nifty sale, by artist Beeple, which is a world record)\n- __$370,000__ (made by 18-year old artist FEWOCiOUS on a single drop on his 18th birthday)\n\nWe founded Nifty Gateway in 2018 with the belief that crypto networks and the blockchain have the power to fundamentally change the art world by creating *__greater choice, independence, and opportunity for artists, creators, and collectors__*. Prior to the development of nifties, digital art was not scarce. It had no beginning and end. It was effortlessly reproducible and therefore, in many ways valueless. Through the creation of unique, identifiable, and secure digital art on the Ethereum blockchain, nifties have given provenance to digital art — and in doing so, given it value. \n\nNifty Gateway’s growth, and the notable success of artists and creators using the platform to sell digital art and collectibles, is another testament to blockchain’s power to change the world and empower individuals through crypto. Join us as we continue to bring new and exciting artists and collections to the platform in 2021!\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nDuncan and Griffin Cock Foster  \nNifty Gateway Co-Founders","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"6L7EBiTcBraF4NZOwCiJpM","blogIntroduction":"We are the world’s first cryptocurrency custodian and exchange to demonstrate this standard of financial operations and security compliance.","datePublished":"Jan 19, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-completes-soc-1-type-2-and-soc-2-type-2-examinations-leading-crypto","title":"Gemini Completes SOC 1 Type 2 and SOC 2 Type 2 Examinations — Leading Crypto Industry","blogAuthors":[{"id":"01oyQ76hc4uXLpugPXZLl","authorName":"Yusuf Hussain","authorPosition":"Head of Risk","intro":"Yusuf Hussain is Gemini's Head of Risk and joined in January 2018.

At Gemini, we believe in another unstoppable force — non-fungible tokens (NFTs). NFTs have allowed artists to create digital artwork that is scarce for the first time in history, and the best part is that there are still so many unexplored use cases. __We believe it is only a matter of time before Esports and NFTs converge in a major way.__ \n\nThat is why we are incredibly excited to announce the release of an exclusive OG Esports NFT collection through our company [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/), on January 23rd at 2pm EST, that features a total of 12 NFTs — each utilizing the 2018 Dota 2 Championship ring.\n\nWe are also simultaneously releasing two open editions in collaboration with the digital artist Filip Hodas. We believe the NFTs featured in the collection will appeal to digital art collectors and Esports fans alike. We look forward to seeing how Esports companies can use NFTs to interact with their fans and enhance fan engagement going forward. \n\nBoth Esports and NFTs are on the rise globally, and mainstream audiences are increasingly exposed to both industries as our world’s digital transformation accelerates. We are incredibly excited that JMR Luna and his team at OG Esports decided to explore NFTs in the Esports space with us, and hope this leads to more innovation at the intersection of NFTs and gaming. We both believe that this is the next step forward for brands and teams looking to connect and provide valuable collectibles and merchandise to their fanbase, and we hope to see the use of NFTs among Esports teams proliferate in the coming year.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTyler Winkelvoss  \nChief Executive Officer","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"40jRgQN8v76O23DpLmZoJJ","blogIntroduction":"The Gemini Credit Card will let you earn up to 3% back in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for every dollar you spend!","datePublished":"Jan 14, 2021","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-to-offer-credit-card-with-crypto-rewards","title":"Gemini to Offer Credit Card with Crypto Rewards","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

We donated $25K to Slice Out Hunger and No Kid Hungry, and through our partnerships we delivered 500+ pizzas to New York’s bravest. Bitcoin Pizza Day commemorates a now famous transaction of 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas. At the current bitcoin price that’s more than $260 million for two pies!\n\nWe invite you to continue supporting [these important groups](https://getstarted.gemini.com/bitcoin-pizza-day/).\n\n__Looking Ahead__\n\nWe look forward to building on our 2020 initiatives by continuing to expand our relationship with the organizations and people that have helped shape Gemini Gives Back.

In light of these ongoing events, we want to share how these attacks work, discuss Gemini’s ongoing actions to protect our customers, and provide some tips for YouTube channel owners to better secure their accounts.\n\n__What Happened With the Hacked Accounts Impersonating Gemini?__  \n\nThe hacked YouTube accounts involved in this month’s events belonged to popular gamers [Natalan](https://www.youtube.com/natalan) and [El Fedelobo](https://www.youtube.com/user/elfedelobo), both of whom lost access to their YouTube channels. The hackers then used the compromised accounts to impersonate Gemini and perpetuate a cryptocurrency giveaway scam. Thankfully, after numerous reports flagging the videos and channels as scams, YouTube was able to step in and restore channel access to the rightful owners.\n\n__How Crypto Giveaway Scams Work__\n\nGiveaway scams are the most prevalent type of crypto scam and are typically posted to Facebook, Twitter, Medium, and YouTube. \n\nMost of these scams have similar components:\n\n1. A hacker compromises and/or impersonates a social media account of a prominent public figure or crypto exchange. \n2. The account begins soliciting bitcoin or ethereum with a “send one, get two back” scheme. For any unsuspecting victims who send through crypto to the wallets highlighted on the fake accounts, that crypto will be lost forever. To be clear, __neither Gemini, nor any reputable cryptocurrency exchange, will ask you to transfer cryptocurrency payments through social media accounts__. To deposit cryptocurrency with Gemini, always make sure you receive the wallet address directly from [Gemini.com](https://www.gemini.com/).\n3. Scammers often go one step further by incorporating a sense of urgency. This could manifest itself as a “Live Video” on YouTube or a statement noting that only a limited number of coins will be \"given\" away. The goal here is to encourage victims to act quickly and without scrutiny.\n\nOnce a victim sends funds to a \"giveaway\" address, they are gone forever. Due to the finality of cryptocurrency transactions, there is no way to reverse a transaction unless the recipient decides to return the funds. This makes these types of “giveaway” scams highly effective for malicious actors.\n\n__What We’re Doing to Protect Gemini Users__\n\nGemini’s Security Team takes scams seriously and we use custom developed tools and third party services to proactively search the web and social media for scams, including those impersonating our brand. We are constantly analyzing trends in the space, updating our procedures, and building upon our scam detection systems.\n\nOnce alerted to a scam, Gemini protects our customers by blocking transactions to bad wallet addresses. Within the past three months alone, Gemini has prevented dozens of transactions destined for scam wallet addresses, saving our customers more than $200k.\n\n__How to Protect Yourself From Crypto Scams__\n\nThe best protection is to educate yourself — anyone seeking to invest in cryptocurrency should be acutely aware of scams impacting the industry. Gemini covered a number of scams affecting the crypto ecosystem in a [previous blog post](https://www.gemini.com/blog/common-online-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them). An easy rule of thumb is that __if you don’t recognize a website or social media account, do not interact with it__. Gemini will never ask you to send cryptocurrency through social media, and other reputable exchanges shouldn’t do so either. \n\n__How to Protect Yourself as a YouTube Channel Owner__\n\nThe events earlier this month not only affected the targets of the crypto scam, but also the YouTube channel owners. It can be confusing and frustrating to wake up one day to see your channel changed without your permission. If you find yourself in this predicament, [follow these steps](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/76187) laid out by Google to recover your account. Additionally, to protect yourself from this ever happening in the first place, it's important to [secure your Youtube account](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9701986). We would like to highlight using security keys for two-step verification as an especially strong defense against account takeovers. In fact, this is what we at Gemini [recommend to our customers](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-becomes-first-crypto-exchange-to-support-hardware-security-keys-on) as well. \n\nOnline scams are not new or limited to the cryptocurrency industry. But crypto users must be more aware of scams since all crypto transactions are final, unlike in traditional banking. Gemini’s Security and Fraud teams are continuously enhancing our ability to protect our customers from scams and other threats. If you’re passionate about building security solutions that solve unique challenges, consider applying to one of the [many roles](https://www.gemini.com/careers/security) we have open on the Security Team at Gemini. \n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTory Cullen  \nAssociate Director, Threat Detection \u0026 Response","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"3rZCT8DlqcSZztKRZ9o0Dl","blogIntroduction":"This month marked the momentous launch of Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0 and we are excited to support its implementation.","datePublished":"Dec 17, 2020","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-to-support-ethereum-2-0-trading-and-staking","title":"Gemini to Support Ethereum 2.0 Trading and Staking","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"},{"id":"6YOO1AbXTB53ko4aLrGSGO","type":"Engineering"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"7bH0oo0sX2vlq9ONnKIIHq","alt":"eth2.0","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/7bH0oo0sX2vlq9ONnKIIHq/7c5be7f5b475c37cefd0fc148e5b4ea0/Blog_Header_-_Eth_2.0.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"This month marked the momentous launch of Ethereum 2.0 Phase 0.

That’s why it’s important you use two-factor authentication, often called 2FA, to protect your accounts.\n\nWhile all types of 2FA are more secure than using just a password, some do a better job of keeping your credentials safe. In this article, we’ll break down the three most common types of 2FA methods from least to most secure. \n\n__One-Time Passwords (OTPs)__\n\nOTPs are by far the most common 2FA method due to their ease of use. The most common iteration of OTPs is a random password (only briefly valid) sent via SMS, email, or provided through a mobile application that you must use in addition to a password. \n\nThe downfall of OTPs is that they are still passwords and therefore have the same weaknesses. If an attacker gains access to one of these codes, no matter how briefly, then your account could be at risk. Despite this risk, you should still use this method when available — in 2019, [Google said](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html) that SMS-based 2FA helped block 96% of phishing attacks. \n\n__Push-Based 2FA__\n\nPush-based two-factor authentication is less common but more secure than OTPs because there’s no password involved. In a push-based authentication flow, the website you’re logging in to sends a push notification to a phone with a request to authenticate. This method can be facilitated by Security as a Service (SaaS) providers like Duo or Okta, and is often used for enterprise authentication. \n\nThe largest security concern for push-based 2FA is accepting an impostrous push, where an attacker has already stolen your password and initiates a push notification which you erroneously accept. \n\n__Hardware Security Tokens__ \n\nEarlier this month, we advised you to [use hardware security keys everywhere you can](https://gemini.com/blog/keep-yourself-and-your-cryptos-secure-with-one-simple-step/) to enhance your online security. \n\nThe safest way to implement 2FA is with a Universal Two-Factor security token, or U2F. When employing this type of hardware security token, a website requests a U2F authentication. You are then prompted to connect the security token to your computer using USB, Bluetooth, or sometimes via Near Field Communication (NFC), and the token cryptographically signs the site’s request.\n\nMost importantly, this method does not use passwords. \n\nUsing a hardware key provides an extra level of security as you must physically interact with the token by either pressing it or tapping it against your laptop or mobile device. This means there’s little to no chance of incorrectly approving a request since the key is speaking directly to the website through your device.\n\n__WebAuthn: Leaving Passwords Behind__\n\nThe shortcomings among OTPs, push-based 2FA, and hardware security tokens is that they all just serve as a cover for the main problem: passwords. \n\n[WebAuthn](https://gemini.com/blog/securing-your-gemini-account-with-webauthn) is a standalone authentication method that leaves passwords in the past: the end goal is to replace multi-factor authentication with a strong and cryptographic single factor authentication. Simply, WebAuthn is a browser application programming interface that allows you to register and prove ownership of your credentials for a given website.\n\nMany devices capable of either verifying you biometrically or with a PIN are also capable of handling WebAuthn requests. Laptops that support Windows Hello, many Android phones, and most recently released iOS devices are all capable of using WebAuthn because the same hardware used for local authentication can be applied. \n\nGemini gives everyone the ability to protect their accounts using the best security standards available. While you will still need a Gemini password for now, you can start using WebAuthn with either a [hardware security token](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044275792) or with Windows Hello and TouchID supported laptops.\n\nIn the meantime, we have partnered with hardware security key maker Yubico to promote staying safe online.

More accounts means more potential for your username and password to become compromised. \n\nThe average user has more than 100 accounts linked to a single email address, all of which should have a unique password. Without a password manager many people are likely to reuse passwords across various accounts or use weak passwords that are easy to remember. \n\nAttackers nowadays tend to be computer programs that are quick and effective at both figuring out weak passwords and helping convince unsuspecting users into handing over their credentials, typically through fraudulent emails. Known as phishing attacks, these fraudulent emails are among the most common threat vectors on the web. \n\nVerizon’s RISK team noted in their [annual Data Breach investigations report](https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/) that, since at least 2017, more than 80% of data breaches have leveraged stolen or weak credentials. This data point may make it sound like users are primarily responsible for these breaches, but credentials can also be stolen from vulnerable websites without you even knowing about it. \n\n__Second Factors for Increased Account Security__\n\nOur current system of using passwords is inherently flawed. Your password is a secret that only you’re supposed to know, but the minute it is compromised, there’s little recourse until you’re notified of the breach. One way to protect your accounts is to use some form of second factor, which serves as a second layer of protection to ensure the security of your accounts. \n\nIf passwords are something you know, then a second factor (2FA) is something that you have. The actual thing-that-you-have for a second-factor can vary: \n\n  1. it could be a cell phone, capable of receiving one-time passcodes after you’ve typed in a password\n  2. it could be a security token, that either displays a one-time code or plugs directly into your computer, authenticating you to a website when you touch it \n  3. it may also not even be a thing, like an email account through which you can receive codes or direct links to access a website \n\nThese 2FAs provide an additional layer of authentication, requiring you to have access to a device or application and use it to provide an extra credential that you wouldn’t know on your own.\n\nNot all 2FAs are created equal, however. Tune in next week where we take a deep dive into the different types of 2FAs and how they stack up against each other. \n\nIn the meantime, we have partnered with hardware security key maker Yubico to promote staying safe online.

Gemini’s security team wanted to take this opportunity to share one of the most impactful steps we think you can take to protect yourself and your crypto: use a hardware security key.\n\n__More Than a Token Gesture__\n\nTo start, we suggest you use hardware security keys like [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/?utm_source=Gemini-blog-oct15) or [Google’s Titan Key](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) for all your important online accounts, including Gemini. \n\nA hardware security key keeps your account safe even if your password is compromised. They provide the strongest level of protection when authenticating to your Gemini account by delivering hardware-backed, cryptographic proof of your identity, ensuring that only you, the holder of the physical hardware key, can gain access to your account, even if an attacker has compromised your password or successfully executed a SIM-swap attack on your mobile device.\n\nGemini employs [WebAuthn](https://webauthn.guide), which is considered the gold standard of hardware security key authentication for web applications, to ensure user accounts are kept secure. Logging in is faster and simpler with a two-step process: \n\n- Enter your username and password\n- Tap the hardware security key with your finger or hold it to the back of your smartphone\n\n__How Do I Set Up a Hardware Security Key on Gemini?__\n\nYou can register your hardware security keys to your Gemini account and review some frequently asked questions [here](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044275792-How-Do-I-Use-My-Security-Key-). Or, watch How to Add a Hardware Security Key to Your Gemini Account.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NB2-CE6wgeE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe Gemini mobile app ([Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gemini.android.app\u0026hl=en_US), [Apple app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gemini-buy-bitcoin-instantly/id1408914447)) is the [first crypto exchange mobile app](https://blog.gemini.com/blog/gemini-becomes-first-crypto-exchange-to-support-hardware-security-keys-on) that can be used with dedicated hardware security keys. Just hold your YubiKey 5 NFC, YubiKey 5C NFC or Google Titan Key to the back of your phone and enter your password to login via mobile in the safest and most secure manner possible.\n\n__Two Hardware Security Keys Are Better Than One__\n\nIf all this is music to your ears then you may want to jump in with both feet and enable your account to only use security keys to log in. To do this, register two hardware security keys so you can use one as a backup in case your primary security key is lost, stolen, or damaged. Once you’ve added a second security key you can disable other non-hardware-based security features on your account. \n\nTo set up a second hardware security key head to your Gemini account settings and click the security tab. If you already have a security key registered to your account you’ll have the option to add a second key.\n\nFor Cybersecurity Awareness Month we partnered with Yubico to help users take their account security to the next level.

They discussed misconceptions around the anonymity of Bitcoin, the importance of financial privacy in the modern world, and how regulation and privacy can co-exist.\n\nHere, we have collected a few soundbites from the Q\u0026A:\n\nAs transactions move increasingly online there is a desire for more anonymity and control in our financial lives and ZEC shielded withdrawals can play an important role in providing you with the privacy you deserve. \n\n*There are false narratives around Bitcoin being anonymous — it is really anything but. As we move more and more online, our transactions, especially in the case of Bitcoin, are pretty out in the open. We have seen surveillance capitalism, we have seen the stories, we know what is happening __with data and privacy__ on that level — __money is the next battleground__.\n*\n— Cameron Winklevoss\n\nYour individual data is collected across the web, and financial data can provide expansive insights into your private financial life. Controlling the dissemination of that data is not always possible, but shielded ZEC withdrawals provide a unique opportunity to do so. \n\n*We know now that __data is valuable, it's exploitable, it's dangerous, it’s intimate, and it’s personal__. \n*\n— Zooko Wilcox \n\nBoth Gemini and Zcash have worked closely with regulators across the globe, and the launch of shielded ZEC withdrawals helps illustrate that privacy coins are not inherently problematic for regulators.  \n\n*I think the Gemini Zcash announcement is a blueprint for future discussions with regulators. The  New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), the premier regulator in New York and a bellwether for regulation in the U.S. and around the world, got comfortable with Zcash so __every other regulator should hopefully be able to find comfort in it too__.\n*\n— Tyler Winklevoss\n\nMissed the livestream or want more insights?

The pandemic has stunted economic growth globally and created a bleak outlook for the traditional banking system in the years to come. Now, more than any other time in recent history, do citizens of the world need a new choice outside of the current system. \n\nDeFi offers such choice. Like a warm ray of sunlight shining down on us during the winter of our financial discontent, DeFi promises greater __choice__, __independence__, and __opportunity__ for all. Gemini shares this ethos. And that is why we are committed to building a trustworthy skybridge for you to traverse into this new, exciting frontier.\n\nAt its core DeFi is permissionless finance, underpinned by smart contract technology. Using blockchain-based smart contracts, DeFi replaces much of the functionality currently offered by traditional finance, delivering more value with less friction than legacy financial services providers. For example, current bank interest rates are at an all time low and many consumers have few options to earn an attractive yield on their capital. Borrowing and lending DeFi protocols like Maker, Aave, and Compound, provide an alternative for some, who might be willing to take on more risk and earn a higher rate of return.\n\nToday, in that vein, we have added new support for 15 additional DeFi tokens. We believe in the potential of DeFi and are here to help usher in this next wave of growth and financial innovation for the world. We are excited by the number of worthy DeFi projects being built by impressive, dedicated teams that are already helping individuals around the world become their own bank and achieve financial freedom. \n\nBy supporting these DeFi tokens, we aim to provide you with a simple and secure way to acquire and store these tokens so you can participate in the DeFi ecosystem. We also offer the [Gemini dollar](https://gemini.com/dollar) (GUSD), our regulated stablecoin, as another avenue of entry. \n\nWe are in the early stages of the DeFi movement and look forward to continuing to help you on your journey into this magical, financial galaxy.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron \u0026 Tyler \n\n*Note: DeFi presents unique risks. The listing of a DeFi token on Gemini does not indicate that Gemini or any regulatory authority has endorsed the underlying project or protocol.

Trading and custody are now available for the following seven tokens, which are entirely new on our platform: __Balancer (BAL)__, __Curve (CRV)__, __Ren Network (REN)__, __Synthetix Network (SNX)__, __Uma (UMA)__, __Uniswap (UNI)__, and __Yearn.finance (YFI)__.\n\nThe following five tokens, which had been previously only supported for custody, are now also available for trading: __Decentraland (MANA)__, __Kyber Network (KNC)__, __Maker (MKR)__, __Storj (STORJ)__, and __0x (ZRX)__. \n\nAnd finally, the following three tokens, which are entirely new on our platform as well, are now supported for custody: __Keep Network (KEEP)__, __Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC)__, and __tBTC (tBTC)__.\n\nWith these new token additions, we now offer trading and custody support for a total of __24__ cryptos and custody support for another __10__ cryptos. Learn more about these cryptos [here](https://gemini.com/prices).\n\nWe are proud to be the __first regulated platform to offer trading and custody support in the State of New York__ for the following tokens: BAL, CRV, KNC, MKR, REN, SNX, STORJ, UMA, UNI, YFI, and ZRX.\n\nThe Decentralized Finance (DeFi) revolution is coming into bloom and it presents the possibility of permissionless, bankless, alternatives to the legacy financial system. Its promise is aligned with our ethos of giving you greater choice, independence, and opportunity. And these new tokens make up some of the major building blocks of DeFi.\n\nWe look forward to continuing to bring you mission-oriented crypto projects in the future.\n\nPlease contact [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com) with any questions.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n*Note: DeFi presents unique risks. The listing of a DeFi token on Gemini does not indicate that Gemini or any regulatory authority has endorsed the underlying project or protocol. While some of our customers may choose to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, Gemini makes no recommendation that they do so. *\n\nLearn more about these new tokens below:\n\n![0x](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2DzIOg2BXrl7JPlhuQeIrq/ee32598fb85de676cce1234bd5437df3/0x.png)\n\n__0x (ZRX)__\n\nZRX is the governance token of 0x, an open protocol for decentralized exchange on the Ethereum blockchain. The 0x protocol aims to create an open standard for decentralized applications (dApps) that want to build decentralized exchange (DEX) functionality by providing a mechanism that allows an order book and order placement to be made off-chain while keeping trade settlement on-chain. This increases efficiency by eliminating the cost to post, modify, or cancel an order and reduces the burden on the Ethereum network by limiting on-chain transactions to trade settlement, the moment when value is actually transferred. You can see the [price of ZRX](https://gemini.com/prices/0x) and more information by following the link.\n\n![BAL](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/67HdGwVvnpgh8XxvN4AqWv/3dadd05bd08f36fc14ba2b99dcdbd931/BAL.png)\n\n__Balancer (BAL)__\n\nBAL is the governance token of the Balancer protocol, a non-custodial portfolio manager and automated market maker built on Ethereum that pools up to eight different tokens for users to trade. These Balancer pools are self-balancing weighted portfolios with specific triggers, and the Balancer protocol allows all Ethereum accounts to add tokens to existing public pools or create their own private pools. The resulting market system creates a structure resembling an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), which continuously rebalances and pays both trading fees and BAL tokens to liquidity providers. You can see the [price of BAL](https://gemini.com/prices/balancer) and more information by following the link.\n\n![CRV](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4PpegJjjrP97tIBhyzM337/cb411f4e4c17d6fc7e8a553848d603b6/CRV.png)\n\n__Curve (CRV)__\n\nCRV is the governance token of Curve, a decentralized exchange optimized for low slippage and low fee swaps between assets pegged to the same value. CRV is a governance token and is also used to pay liquidity providers. Curve is an automated market maker that operates similarly to Balancer, relying on liquidity pools and rewarding those who fund the pools, except it only deals with stablecoins (e.g., DAI, TUSD, sUSD, GUSD, bUSD, USDC, etc.). For this reason, it can be useful to crypto users seeking to swap stablecoins, traders looking for arbitrage opportunities, and liquidity providers who earn trading and interest fees. It also offers an incentivizing boost mechanism for users to lock in their token holdings for up to four years,  allowing them to earn more on their liquidity and receive more in trading fees. Because fees depend on trading volumes, liquidity providers earn more value on days with high volume and high volatility. You can see the [price of CRV](https://gemini.com/prices/curve) and more information by following the link.\n\n![MANA](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/ZVuCqAoF9YTPIMocsTx0j/b5dd869925cec72528750aa9c623361c/MANA.png)\n\n__Decentraland (MANA)__\n\nMANA is the digital asset token used to pay for goods and services in Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual reality platform where users can buy, develop, and sell LAND, a non-fungible ERC-721 token that represents the ownership of virtual land in Decentraland. Each parcel of LAND is unique and owners get to choose what content they want to publish on their portion land, which can range from a simple, static scene to an interactive game. MANA can be used to purchase LAND as well as all other goods and services in Decentraland. In Decentraland, users can connect and interact with each other, create content, and play games, as well as engage in a virtual economy and monetize the content and applications they build. You can see the [price of MANA](https://gemini.com/prices/decentraland) and more information by following the link.\n\n![KNC](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5NXJ5FnBYDOUKAhQEueoiv/0765cdac24d2a524acf95ae9a5b2dd66/KNC.png)\n\n__Kyber Network (KNC)__\n\nKNC is a token that provides a governance, treasury, and economic function on the Kyber Network, a decentralized on-chain liquidity protocol designed to make trading tokens simple, efficient, robust, and secure via smart contracts. Here’s how it works: A user who is looking to trade token A for token B will deposit token A into the reserve pool and detail their conditions for the trade. The pool will then match the trade to the most favorable rate as determined by third party liquidity providers and smart contract monitors within the network called Reserve Managers. If the match is acceptable to the initiator, the smart contract will release token B back to them in an instant transaction processed by the network. KNC holders can stake KNC in the network, vote on parameters, and earn staking rewards in ETH. The open source nature of the network allows any decentralized application to tap into its smart contract system and use Kyber Network as liquidity infrastructure to transfer, exchange, or otherwise interact. You can see the [price of KNC](https://gemini.com/prices/kybernetwork) and more information by following the link.\n\n![MKR](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4CbzFXDwkQZfQWeiyAVRZF/d0b2cbd719aecb2639ede00283514cb5/MKR.png)\n\n__Maker (MKR)__\n\nMKR is the governance token of the Maker protocol, a peer-to-contract lending platform that powers the DAI stablecoin. Those that hold MKR have the ability to participate in the governance of the Maker Protocol, which means voting on the protocol’s collateral parameters, stability fees, savings rates, and more — thereby giving holders a stake in the management of the financial risks of Dai. You can see the [price of MKR](https://gemini.com/prices/maker) and more information by following the link.\n\n![REN](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/55IIakPwaWVcjOIZ7OPvum/2a358ba5f64adc01ffad8d9ad682837d/REN.png)\n\n__Ren Network (REN)__\n\nREN is the native token of the Ren protocol, an open protocol that enables the permissionless and private transfer of value between any blockchain. Ren's core product, RenVM, brings interoperability to decentralized finance (DeFi). REN primarily functions as a bond to run a Darknode, which powers the network (RenVM). Darknodes (and those who run them) earn rewards (in BTC, ETH, ZEC, etc.) for contributing to the network. You can see the [price of REN](https://gemini.com/prices/ren) and more information by following the link.\n\n![STORJ](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/7z4icqtOU47TYe8yCBDNwC/e0eb8cdfd24a36f17b82a068b58212d9/STORJ.png)\n\n__Storj (STORJ)__\n\nSTORJ is a digital asset token that can be used to pay for services on Storj, a decentralized, peer-to-peer cloud storage network. It aims to connect users looking to purchase storage space with users who have hard drive space to sell — thus eliminating the need for a trusted third party. This solves for most traditional data breaches, failures, and outages, while at the same time increasing a user’s security, privacy, and data control. Users are incentivized to use STORJ tokens for these purchases, however, the network also supports fiat currencies. Users who provide hardware for storage purposes also earn STORJ tokens. You can see the [price of STORJ](https://gemini.com/prices/storj) and more information by following the link.\n\n![SNX](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/uqyM6aMsCVGoJRkysrJ3x/933b0a4ca9ad822e34af345cb562f238/SNX.png)\n\n__Synthetix Network (SNX) __\n\nSNX is a token for minting synthetic assets on the Synthetix Network, a decentralized trading ecosystem. Synthetix is an asset issuance protocol, where users can create “synthetic” versions of stocks, crypto, or other financial instruments through smart contracts. There is an exchange as well as a decentralized application to facilitate trading of the instruments issued on Synthetix. The SNX token is an entry point into Synthetix — in order to participate in the ecosystem, users can stake their SNX tokens. By doing so, users can obtain synthetic USD, or sUSD, or another synthetic instrument such as sBTC. You can see the [price of SNX](https://gemini.com/prices/synthetix) and more information by following the link.\n\n![UMA](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1PYyZlnmAxMx04jn3iFy1o/ae73efbab71214a0826439cd843ffb3e/UMA.png)\n\n__Uma (UMA)__\n\nUMA is the governance token of the Universal Market Access (UMA) project, a protocol for the development, issuance, and settlement of synthetic tokens for any underlying asset built on the Ethereum blockchain. A user can generate and create smart contract-governed meta-tokens based off of a derivative, and then take a position long or short of that asset without needing to hold the underlying asset. UMA uses its Data Verification Mechanism (DVM) to resolve disputes over improper liquidations of collateral. UMA token holders are called in to vote on these disputes. You can see the [price of UMA](https://gemini.com/prices/uma) and more information by following the link.\n\n![UNI](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2aVhOfvYaX7VznfLw0R1Tc/69c19bf15ae7a1ee25de21490f3dcd09/UNI.png)\n\n__Uniswap (UNI)__\n\nUNI is the governance token of Uniswap, a decentralized exchange that uses liquidity pools (LPs) to make markets instead of a typical order book. These pools are defined by smart contracts that facilitate the swapping of tokens and the adding of liquidity —  there are no order books, centralized parties, or central facilitators. Uniswap users pool two assets that are then traded against, with the price determined by the ratio between the two. Anyone with ERC-20 tokens can add liquidity to these pools by adding an equal value of each token to the LP. When providing liquidity to an LP, users receive a LP token that is redeemable for the underlying assets plus fees at any time, and fees are evenly distributed amongst the individual pool. You can see the [price of UNI](https://gemini.com/prices/uniswap) and more information by following the link.\n\n![YFI](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/79bKCzZAVjrGWCzjHFEMZr/ad4484e25a7ae8e2edfefb2fe012ffd8/YFI.png)\n\n__Yearn.finance (YFI)__\n\nYFI is the governance token of Yearn.finance, a decentralized aggregator of various lending protocols that optimizes for the highest yield. It utilizes lending services such as Aave, StableCredit, Compound, Dydx, and dXdY to optimize token lending by aggregating several DeFi platforms and then queries them for whichever provides the highest annual yield and allocates assets accordingly. YFI is used for governance over the network and is distributed exclusively through active participation and liquidity provision. You can see the [price of YFI](https://gemini.com/prices/yearn) and more information by following the link. \n\n![KEEP](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1gXvcBk53SA9o587eHf1rs/fc51198923b046599af66a44da2571e7/KEEP.png)\n\n__Keep Network (KEEP) __\n\nKEEP is the token that powers Keep, a privacy layer for public blockchains allowing users and apps to privately transfer information from one party to another and store data in off-chain containers called “keeps.” KEEP is a work token, which means that its holders have the right to perform major functions on the network. This work is to allow off-chain storage and retrieval of private information. KEEP holders are required to delegate a minimum amount of their tokens as collateral and provide storage space in order to earn rewards. You can see the [price of KEEP](https://gemini.com/prices/keepnetwork) and more information by following the link.\n\n![WBTC](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2QVKNvL8AV3YQYtCk83HdV/dbde80e22d07e271e729941b3c6a943a/WBTC.png)\n\n__Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) __\n\nwBTC is a wrapped version of BTC, which means that it is backed 1:1 with bitcoin. This wrapped token brings the value of bitcoin into the Ethereum ecosystem. wBTC can be traded on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap, and borrowed and lent on Compound and Aave. With wBTC, the custody method is more centralized and managed by a consortium of firms. You can see the [price of wBTC](https://gemini.com/prices/wrappedbitcoin) and more information by following the link. \n\n![TBTC](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/V8mDuFUnV3LbRgkJciLBO/6ffe1a0fb0a0fec13fc7b8acc88a1673/TBTC.png)\n\n__tBTC (tBTC)__\n\ntBTC is a Bitcoin-backed token pegged to the price of bitcoin. It allows holders to use bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain and access the DeFi ecosystem. A user can obtain tBTC by depositing BTC into a specific wallet through the tBTC Decentralized App within the Bitcoin blockchain. With tBTC, the custody method is a decentralized pool of custodians who each have to supply a good behavior collateral bond in Ether. You can see the [price of tBTC](https://gemini.com/prices/tbtc) and more information by following the link.","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"15rI805VGP4trEumS3c1Zq","blogIntroduction":"We are excited to announce that you can now use your debit card to buy crypto with any of our supported fiat currencies. \n","datePublished":"Sep 24, 2020","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":true,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-introduces-debit-card-support","title":"Gemini Introduces Debit Card Support","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"2dpgn6gR3vS8WOpDGSs4Pf","alt":"Gemini-Debit cards crypto-Blog","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2dpgn6gR3vS8WOpDGSs4Pf/4c8c65050ec9b1df9463e2ce5070cc93/Blog_Header_-_fund_with_your_debit_card.jpg"},"blogPostContent":"We are excited to announce that you can now use your debit card to buy crypto on Gemini.\n\nAdd your debit card by logging into your Gemini account via our mobile app or website.

Each PAXG token is backed by one fine troy ounce (t oz) of a 400 oz London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in Brink’s vaults. PAXG gives you the benefits of actual physical ownership of gold with the speed and mobility of a digital asset. Unlike physical gold, PAXG is divisible (you can have fractional ownership of physical bars), liquid (you can trade it for fiat or cryptocurrency), and digital (securely store it on the Gemini Exchange and access anytime, anywhere).  \n\n![Gemini Crypto-Flexacoin AMP](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6tBovQ8dCoVHSFG4WqE68i/2c15c0f3abac5af384f6f881397df174/Gemini_Crypto-Flexacoin_AMP.png)\n\n__Amp__ is a digital collateral token for the [Flexa network](https://flexa.network/), a payment system that allows you to spend certain cryptocurrencies supported on the Gemini exchange with select retailers at their brick and mortar locations.\n\n*How It Works:* When you make a purchase from a retailer via an app with Flexa, such as Gemini Pay, that app pays Flexa from your account in the cryptocurrency of your choosing and Flexa pays the retailer in their currency of choice. Flexa uses Amp as collateral to secure your payment from the time of purchase to the time of settlement with the merchant. If for any reason a Flexa-enabled app does not pay, Flexa uses the Amp staked to that app in order to repay the merchant. In this way, the amount of Amp staked to a given app acts as an upper limit on how much money that app can owe the Flexa network at any time. In return for staking Amp to a given app, network participants receive a portion of the processing fees earned by the Flexa network for all transactions processed through that app.\n\n![Gemini Crypto-Compound COMP](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2f7czh4kLLyJ31herL13KC/3ec98fbac265093407eaca64cea680e7/Gemini_Crypto-Compound_COMP.png)\n\n__Compound__ is an open-source platform that allows you to lend and earn interest, or borrow and pay interest, against your crypto.\n\n*How It Works:* You either lend or borrow crypto on the platform and you receive a “cToken” in exchange, corresponding to the specific asset you lent or borrowed. The Compound protocol algorithmically determines the interest rate that you earn or pay, so it changes with the markets every day. COMP is the governance token of the Compound system – you earn small amounts of COMP token for participating in the platform, and holding COMP allows you to vote in changes to the protocol. One percent of COMP holders must support a given change, and if a governance change to the protocol is passed it will take effect two days later giving anyone with a negatively affected position the time to close it out.\n\nThese assets expand the range of our platform and further our mission to empower the individual through crypto.

First with Cryptokitties, and soon thereafter with a growing variety of digital art, we saw a passionate community of crypto enthusiasts and devout collectors develop and grow in parallel. And, we understood why. We realized very quickly that blockchain had the power to fundamentally change digital art, a medium that before was effortlessly reproducible and therefore in many ways, valueless.\n \nBut, by creating unique, identifiable, and secure digital art on the Ethereum blockchain, Nifites solved that problem by giving provenance to digital art – and with provenance, comes value. An exact replica of the *Mona Lisa*, brush stroke for brush stroke, is beautiful to look at on your wall, but ultimately worthless. The actual *Mona Lisa*, the painting in the Louvre, that we know without any doubt was created by the hand of Leonardo Da Vinci, is priceless. With the provenance that comes from being uniquely identifiable on-blockchain, you can now know without a shadow of a doubt that your specific piece of digital art was created by the hand of the artist – and that provenance cannot be copied or forged. Maybe it too will one day be priceless!\n \nSince our launch we have attracted many of the most respected artists of our generation to the Nifty Marketplace: Cey Adams, Kenny Scharf, Jon Burgerman, and of course, Trevor Jones – just to name a few. We have held 13 successful drops, almost all of which have sold out in minutes, and those nifties have almost all increased in value and seen active trading on the secondary market. We are just getting started.\n \nIn the coming months we plan to continue to frequently drop new collections of digital art with some of the most prominent and exciting artists in the world, bringing more and more unique and beautiful art into your life. We are working on a display app and hardware technology, so you can proudly display your digital art in your home or office. And, we will continue to build out the Nifty Marketplace itself, adding more intuitive features and functionality so that you can continue to have a simple, elegant, and secure experience when buying, selling, viewing, and storing your digital art on our platform.\n \nThe Nifty ecosystem is flourishing. We invite you to explore this exciting new medium with us.\n \nOnward and Upward,\n\nDuncan and Griffin Cock Foster\n \n*The [Nifty Marketplace](https://niftygateway.com/) is an all-in-one platform where you can buy, sell, and store your digital art and collectibles.

Gemini customers can now use USB and near-field communication (NFC) security keys to securely sign into the Gemini Mobile App. \n\nHardware security keys provide __the strongest level of protection when authenticating to your Gemini account__ by delivering hardware-backed, cryptographic proof of your identity. They ensure that only the holder of the physical hardware key can gain access to an associated account, even if an attacker has compromised your password or successfully executed a SIM-swap attack on your mobile device. This mitigates the risk posed by phishing, person-in-the-middle, and replay attacks that rely on stolen passwords or one-time password (OTP) codes.\n\nTo help our customers take advantage of this new offering, we have partnered with [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com) — maker of the popular hardware security key, YubiKey. Along with existing platform authenticators (e.g. TouchID and Windows Hello), YubiKeys provide a secure, cross-platform solution you can use to access your Gemini account via our Mobile App, as well as any other sites that support WebAuthn. You can learn more about our partnership with Yubico on the [Works With YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/works-with-yubikey/catalog/gemini/) web page. \n\nIn order to exclusively rely on hardware security keys and disable Authy/SMS based  authentication, you will need to register at least two hardware keys, including one supported by your mobile device. This could include a platform security key such as MacOS [TouchID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207054) or [Windows Hello](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028017/windows-learn-about-windows-hello-and-set-it-up) and a cross-platform hardware security key such as a YubiKey. To learn more about selecting and using the right security keys to access your account, refer to Gemini’s [support documentation](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044275792) and [instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB2-CE6wgeE). \n\nOur security and engineering teams continue to prioritize new security features in order to provide the best and most secure user experience possible. We look forward to sharing more exciting security-focused announcements in the coming months.

We heard first-hand accounts detailing the discrimination they grew up with, the fears they live with, and the exhaustion they carry. Considering this, we wanted to reexamine the commitments we've made at Gemini and to the global crypto community. \n\nWe must acknowledge that the Black experience in America is marred by racism, inequity, and brutality. The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and Rayshard Brooks are unfortunately just four of the countless examples that reinforce the collective trauma and fear that Black people experience on a daily basis. America promises to provide a free and just society for all its citizens; however, America has — in practice and in fact — systematically breached this social contract with the Black community for hundreds of years.\n\nAt Gemini, we’re making the following affirmations: \n\n1. Black Lives Matter. \n2. Black lives have been disproportionately impacted by systemic racism and injustice in America. \n3. Speaking out against anti-blackness is not a political issue — it’s a humanitarian one. \n4. It’s time to reform systems that discriminate against Black lives.\n5. We stand with the Black community today and forever.\n\nWe’ll express these affirmations clearly through the following actions:\n\n1. Gemini is committed to hiring a full-time person to lead our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) strategy. Systemic issues like anti-blackness and racism require both immediate and long-term action — our DEI strategy will directly address both.\n2. Gemini is committed to providing direct economic support to organizations focused on education, economic, and social justice reform for the Black community. To that end, Gemini will be donating $250K to organizations recommended by, voted on, and chosen by our employees.\n3. Gemini has instituted an annual gift-matching program of up to $1K per employee, per year, to support organizations they choose.\n4. Gemini will designate Juneteenth (June 19th) as an official company holiday.\n\nThis is a complex, centuries-old issue and we recognize that the road to change will not be quick or easy. But that has never stopped Gemini before. \n\nCrypto has the power to offer greater choice, independence, and opportunity. To ensure that everyone has a chance to participate in this promise, we will need to build crypto products that are simple, elegant, and secure and that also incorporate the diverse and inclusive perspectives of individuals with backgrounds that reflect the world we aim to empower.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron + Tyler\n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"5OoMj0lmX4bKqRFblSyPgW","blogIntroduction":"Gemini is the first U.S. crypto exchange and custodian to partner with Samsung Blockchain.\n\n","datePublished":"May 28, 2020","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-integrates-with-samsung-blockchain-wallet","title":"Gemini Integrates With Samsung Blockchain Wallet","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

We at Gemini could not be more excited to witness another great milestone in Bitcoin’s lifecycle.\n \nThe halving is a reaffirmation of one of Bitcoin’s fundamental truths and greatest value propositions: __Bitcoin is predictable, reliable, and trustworthy.__\n \nBut first, a quick refresher. Bitcoin transactions are validated, aggregated into blocks, and added to the Bitcoin blockchain by miners through proof-of-work, a process that requires specialized equipment and a lot of power to run it. In exchange for their time, effort, and costs, miners who are successful in adding a block to the bitcoin blockchain are rewarded with freshly minted bitcoin. The Bitcoin protocol, written so that no more than 21 million bitcoin could ever be created, determines how many new bitcoins miners receive per block. Every 210,000 blocks, which occurs roughly every four years, the protocol is designed to automatically “half” the block reward. On May 11, the block reward will reduce from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC.\n \nThe price of one bitcoin was about $12 at the first halving in 2012, when the block reward decreased from 50 to 25 BTC. At the second halving in 2016, when the reward went from 25 to 12.5 BTC, bitcoin was priced at about $650 and since then it has risen ever higher — it’s currently trading at more than $8,000 today. \n\nBut, the short- and medium-term effects of the next halving on the price of bitcoin are widely debated. Some traders expect the price to skyrocket as supply decreases and demand surges. Others expect a price drop as some miners exit the market. Many believe that the very nature of the halving, its predictability, is well known, understood, and already priced-in to bitcoin’s current and future market value. \n \nOne issue that is not in question, however, is that Bitcoin’s monetary policy stands in stark contrast, yet again, to traditional monetary policy. Recently, governments across the world have been injecting trillions of dollars into the global economy. While this kind of stimulus can be necessary or helpful, especially in times like these, inflationary forces can potentially reduce the future value of fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s supply remains steady, determined by an unchanging mathematical formula.\n \nIn 2009 Bitcoin’s invention and implementation opened our eyes to the thrilling idea that blockchain and cryptocurrency can shift the balance of power from governments and corporations to you, the individual. Over the past 11 years countless new tokens have come to market, addressing issues ranging from privacy on the internet to broadening access to financial products to the decentralization of content storage and delivery. \n\nOur passion for crypto remains undiminished as we explore these ideas and are inspired by their possibility. But, throughout it all, our attention has never shifted away from Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency. The halving is a great reminder that Bitcoin is functioning as it was intended – predictable, reliable, and still going strong.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nEric Winer, VP of Engineering\n\n\nLearn more about bitcoin and the halving on our [bitcoin price](https://gemini.com/prices/bitcoin) page. \n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2zRB50xRe67WfXIPqkL49E","blogIntroduction":"OXT, BAT, LINK and DAI are now available for trading on the Gemini platform.","datePublished":"May 05, 2020","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"oxt-link-bat-dai-trading-now-available","title":"OXT, LINK, BAT and DAI Trading Now Available","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"ks6kdBxDbUvSOjk8Oomjd","alt":"oxt, bat, dai, link","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/ks6kdBxDbUvSOjk8Oomjd/1e43a4321604da583fed68e6286afb69/Gemini-BAT__DAI__LINK__OXT-Blog.png"},"blogPostContent":"We are pleased to announce that [Orchid (OXT)](https://gemini.com/prices/orchid), [Basic Attention Token (BAT)](https://gemini.com/prices/bat), [Chainlink (LINK)](https://gemini.com/prices/chainlink), and [Dai (DAI)](https://gemini.com/prices/dai) are now available for trading on the Gemini platform.\n\n\n__It's Time to Take Back Control of Your Privacy__ \n\nOrchid allows you to browse the Internet privately.

Chainlink solves this problem by allowing Chainlink nodes to fetch and organize data from the Internet and broadcast it onto the Ethereum blockchain for any Ethereum-based smart contract to use. These nodes set their own payment parameters and Chainlink uses Link to pay them. Chainlink can bring information from industries where outcomes are determined by parameters not exhibited on the blockchain, such as insurance, financial contracts, debt obligations, and many others, onto the blockchain.\n\n__Dai__ is a decentralized, crypto-collateralized stablecoin that seeks to maintain a 1:1 soft-peg with the U.S. dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide you with stable crypto dollars to use on the Ethereum network.\n\n*How It Works:* When you deposit ETH or any other supported ERC20 assets into the Maker platform, DAI is created and loaned to you at 66% of the value of your deposit. You can retrieve your collateral deposit by returning the DAI you generated and paying a stability fee. This stability fee increases or decreases based on DAI’s price relative to the U.S. dollar. Supply and demand dynamics are intended to keep DAI’s value close to $1 USD over time. \n\n__Orchid__ is a peer-to-peer marketplace for virtual private networking (VPN) providers. OXT is the token used to purchase VPN bandwidth.\n\n*How It Works:* Built on the Ethereum network, Orchid is designed as an alternative solution to centralized VPN service providers and the Tor network. You can use OXT to pay for VPN services and VPN providers must stake OXT tokens in order to operate on the network and sell bandwidth. The staking structure incentivizes VPN providers to provide quality, secure, and private Internet access without the quality risks of Tor or privacy and centralization risks of centralized VPN providers.\n\nThese assets expand the range of our platform and further our mission to empower the individual through crypto. We have worked closely with the New York State Department of Financial Services to obtain approval to offer trading and custody services for these new assets and we look forward to continuing to bring mission-oriented projects to you in the future. \n\nPlease contact [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com) with any questions. \n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n__Please Note:__ *In order to deposit LINK, DAI, and OXT you must first create a new Ethereum deposit address by logging into Gemini and going to the [Digital Asset Transfers](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209113666-How-do-I-deposit-digital-assets-into-my-Gemini-Account-) page.

If you know what to look for these sites are often easy to identify. Based on our experience we wanted to share some security best practices that can help you quickly spot risky websites and associated scams.\n\n\n# The Basics of Identifying Fraudulent or Malicious Websites\nMany fraudulent or malicious websites rely on impersonating a trusted website. This is typically done through the manipulation of URLs and hyperlinks. \n\n__Go Direct.__\nThe easiest way to avoid an untrustworthy website is to avoid clicking on a link and instead go to a trusted website through a search engine or by typing the URL directly into the browser. \n\n__Check the Address.__\nSometimes it’s not easy to browse directly to a website and we need to click a hyperlink. To reveal the URL that a hyperlink references, on your desktop computer, simply move your mouse over the link (don’t click it).  For Chrome and Firefox, the full URL for the link will appear in the bottom left of the browser. \n\n__Uncover Shortened and Unknown URLs.__\nAny URL can redirect you to another location. When you see a shortened URL that you may suspect is malicious or a URL that is unknown, you’ll need to use a site like [URLscan.io](https://urlscan.io) to help reveal the true URL.¹\n\n![google.com](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/gvvroMxZWhEzIjN05lftl/ea99a6fad492d24a4d9d700b22a91765/google.com.png)\n\nOnce you have the true URL, you’ll need to determine if it’s a legitimate site. In most cases it should be apparent. \n\n__Examine URLs Closely.__\nThere are some techniques that can be used to trick users into thinking a URL is trustworthy, when in fact it is not. Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) homography attacks use look-alike characters to trick users into believing they are accessing the correct URL. Examples include replacing the letter “O” with a zero or the letter “I” with the number one. Chrome and Safari resolve these deceptions when you move your mouse over a link, making them easy to spot. Firefox by default does not — although it is [configurable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Internationalized_domain_names_support_in_Mozilla). \n\n\n# Advanced Tactics for Identifying Fraudulent or Malicious Websites\nIf, after all these steps, you’re still not sure a site is trustworthy, you should probably avoid it. However, if that’s not an option and you’re determined to proceed, there are more steps you can take to determine a website’s trustworthiness. \n\n__Assess Observed Malicious Activity.__\nUsing a scoring system, sites like [[URLscan.io]](https://urlscan.io/) take into account different data sources and page characteristics to determine the likelihood a site is malicious. Below is an example from URLscan.io of a warning displayed for a known phishing site. \n\n![url.io](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2Ibfs8ktmWyniKvDaCZmE3/54536e9d588f86a0f1356a02ff4ca390/url.io.png)\n\n__Validate Certificate Information.__\nToday, most websites utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS) and underlying certificates. These certificates contain valuable information that can be used to gain a better understanding about a website. \n\nThere are three types of certificates: \n- __Domain Validated (DV):__ cheap and easily obtainable\n- __Organization Validated (OV):__ require a registrar to verify a company’s identity, providing an additional level of assurance\n- __Extended Validation (EV):__ most difficult and expensive to obtain, providing the highest level of assurance \n\nA DV certificate contains no identifying information in the organization name field; instead it will typically just repeat the domain name. An OV certificate will include the name of the organization and an EV certificate will contain the name of the organization and the physical address. To check if a site uses an EV certificate, you can use SSL Labs.\n\n![certificate](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/3V3BZE88rG03chNmo4IAQy/30d8fec526d4b2adabc4ac4ed2c01705/certificate.png)\n\nCertificates are strong indicators, but not a guarantee, of a site’s relative trustworthiness.\n\n__Check the Domain Registration Date.__\nMalicious actors tend to create a domain just before use. As a result, if a domain is fairly new, it has a substantially higher chance of being malicious. Legitimate sites don’t often register a domain and then launch an e-commerce site in weeks. Although there will always be exceptions, domain registration date is another piece of information that can be used to determine potential scams or malicious sites. \n\n__Preview the Website.__\nAlthough visiting an untrustworthy site can be risky, viewing a picture of the site won’t cause harm to your computer or result in the loss of personal information. Services like URLscan.io remotely view and capture an image of the site you’ve requested allowing you to take a peek at the site without taking the risk of actually visiting the site itself. With an image, you can assess the site for pixelated images, poor grammar, sloppy design, or other telltale signs of an untrustworthy site. If it looks unprofessional it’s likely not legitimate. \n\n# Preparing for Failure\nEventually everyone clicks on a link or visits a website that contains malicious content. The good news is that when properly used, most modern web browsers and accompanying extensions can act as a security boundary. \n\n__Update Your Browser.__\nModern browsers are very secure if they’re up-to-date and conveniently most now auto-update by default. But, in order to complete an update, you need to restart your browser periodically.  Keeping your browser up-to-date, avoids most problems. \n\n__Block Malicious Content.__\nMalicious content in websites can be hosted in ad networks and/or be present in active website content. There are a number of third-party extensions for major browsers that block or reduce the amount of ads and active content rendered when visiting a website. uBlock origin is a popular ad-blocking extension that is easy to operate and has minimal impact on normal browsing. Although more difficult to use, NoScript is an example of a popular and highly effective extension that blocks active content. \n\n__Use a Password Manager.__\nIn addition to all of their traditional benefits, password managers also only fill out account details on saved sites. So, if you visit a phishing site that is attempting to steal your credentials, the password manager won’t automatically populate your credentials and in some cases may even provide a warning. \n\n# Arming You With Knowledge to Protect Yourself\nFraudulent and malicious websites cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars every year. Hopefully these security best practices will help you to identify and avoid malicious websites.\nRead our [Common Online Scams and How to Avoid Them](https://gemini.com/blog/common-online-scams-and-how-to-avoid-them) post to further help you protect yourself and always remember to use caution and good judgement online. Stay safe out there.\n\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nDave Damato, Chief Security Officer \n\n\n\n\n-----------------\n¹ Limit URLs submitted to third parties to those you suspect are malicious. Legitimate URLs that reference sensitive information could be viewable by a third party. \n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"6yLyzGZQgzS11DrTZv9S3L","blogIntroduction":"Nifty Marketplace is making history by bringing digital art and collectibles onto the blockchain with two fine artists and a world champion athlete.","datePublished":"Mar 17, 2020","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"nifty-marketplace-launches-with-three-limited-edition-collections","title":"Nifty Marketplace Launches With Three Limited Edition Collections","blogAuthors":[{"id":"4Ryug9YQiwcyBiyy7hdnVh","authorName":"Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster","authorPosition":"Founders, Nifty Gateway","intro":"","slug":"duncan-and-griffin-cock-foster","profileImage":{"id":"3ecQzMZlM0TrvFgtCpf4yN","alt":"Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/3ecQzMZlM0TrvFgtCpf4yN/3650628f0f685058a44026c7cd232e60/Duncan_and_Griffin_Cockfoster-Headshot.jpg"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"EWqrVIYL52dpkwfQTAd5p","type":"Industry"},{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"2Gt4ILL7gYxQ3YdIkccint","alt":"2020-03-13 NiftyGateway","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2Gt4ILL7gYxQ3YdIkccint/3effb0e988feca31e4a7e9cf8a9df1a4/2020-03-13_NiftyGateway.png"},"blogPostContent":"The [Nifty Marketplace](https://niftygateway.com/) is now live!

In this blog post, we highlight some common online scams and provide suggestions for how to avoid becoming a victim. *Note: these scams do not uniquely target cryptocurrency users  so whenever you go online, keep these best practices in mind.*\n\n## Tech Support Scams\nTech support scams prey upon people’s fear that their computer is broken or has been compromised.\n\n__The Fake Phone Call__\n\nIn this scam, a criminal will call or email a target and state that their computer has a serious problem such as a virus. The criminal will then ask for remote access to the victim’s computer in order to run a fake diagnostic test and from there can easily steal information. \n\n__The Fake Pop-Up__\n\nIn a pop-up attack a criminal will deploy a pop-up window on a victim’s screen stating there is a problem with the computer that needs to be urgently fixed and request payment to resolve the non-existent issue.\n\n__The Fake Website__\n\nCriminals may also create fake support websites for well-known companies listing a fake support number. When the victim calls, the criminal will pose as a support employee and request remote access, allowing them to easily loot the victim’s account. \n\n## Get Rich Quick Scams\nGet rich quick scams present potential victims with fake investment opportunities that promise large returns in a very short period of time with minimal effort (these schemes often are classified as pyramid or ponzi schemes).  \n\n__The Foreign Prince__\n\nCriminals contact a victim, usually via email or a phone call, and request a small investment or loan for an exotic and seemingly reliable opportunity in exchange for a high rate of return in the near future. \n\n__The (Swamp)land Deal__\n\nCriminals may also post fake advertisements online that promise a small initial investment will yield outsized returns and wait for victims to contact them.\n\n__Bank of Nowhere__\n\nIn a more elaborate get-rich-quick scam, criminals create fake investment platforms that similarly promise victims significant returns in exchange for a nominal investment. These platforms look legitimate and often include fake testimonials from people with inflated bank accounts. Once the victim makes an initial investment on the platform, they will be able to see their portfolio but unable to withdraw their money. When the time comes to pay a return on the investment, the criminal will make excuses as to why the funds can’t be paid and often ask the victim to pay an additional fee to release them.\n\n## Romance Scam\nCriminals pose as an interested romantic partner in order to take advantage of those looking to find companionship. \n\n__Catfishing for Dollars__\n\nA criminal will create a fake dating profile using stolen pictures, then establish a close relationship with a victim over a long period of time taking great pains to avoid in-person interactions. Once the criminal senses the victim is comfortable, they will request money, often giving a reason with great urgency to induce payment (ex. medical expenses, frozen bank account, etc.).\n\n## SIM Swap Scam\nCriminals will acquire a victim’s name and phone number through fraudulent means and use that information to hack into systems connected to the victim’s phone. \n\n__Identity Theft__\n\nHackers continue to build sophisticated methods to target online accounts. One of the more common attacks is called SIM swapping, when an unauthorized individual tricks a mobile carrier into switching an existing phone number to a different device. The unauthorized individual can then intercept texts and calls, including two-factor authentication (2FA) confirmations sent via SMS. \n\n## Spotting Online Scams\n\n__Do Your Homework__\n\nBefore making an investment, take the time to conduct thorough and careful research focusing on reputation, qualifications and credentials. If the opportunity sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Best practice is to check all information with a trusted third party such as a legal or financial professional. \n\n__Know Who You’re Dealing With__\n\nLegitimate tech companies will not contact you by phone, email, text message, or “pop-up” warning to tell you there is a problem with your computer. If you believe something may be wrong with your computer,  reach out to a legitimate  technical professional or physically take your computer into a store to receive in-person support. \n\n__Ask Questions__\n\nIf you’re concerned with the legitimacy of a person, company, or investment  opportunity ‒ ask questions.  Be skeptical anytime anyone asks you to hand over money immediately. The more rushed an investment opportunity may be, the more likely it may be a scam.  \n\n__Only Share Your Private Information With Trusted Parties__\n\nSometimes we have to give our pin numbers, passwords and personal information to access systems and services that we use in our daily lives. Make sure to verify that you are indeed communicating with a legitimate representative of a company you know and trust before revealing private information.\n\n__Don’t Download Anything From Questionable Websites__\n\nIs the URL unusually long and complicated or have spelling errors? Does the website seem especially poorly designed, old or amateurish? If so, you may be on a fraudulent website. Pay close attention to where and how you browse the web and never download anything from a questionable website. \n\n*For Current and Future Gemini Customers:* The best way to avoid losing funds from your Gemini account during a SIM swap scam is to download [Authy](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005755446-How-do-I-download-Authy-) for two-factor authentication disabling the [multi-device](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000053543-Turning-off-Authy-Multi-Device-Support) option. This ensures your device is the only device that can access your Authy account. Please also see [best practices for securing your Gemini account](https://gemini.com/blog/best-practices-for-securing-your-gemini-account).\n\nWe hope that this guide to online scams will help you stay safe and secure as you navigate the tools, technologies and systems that power our everyday lives. \n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nNoah B. Perlman  \nChief Operating Officer\n\n*The preceding examples are not a comprehensive list of all possible risks. Suggestions for avoiding online scams do not guarantee your security.

Whether you’re an experienced day trader, HODLer, institutional investor, or someone who is completely new to crypto, our [20 Things to Know About Crypto in 2020](https://getstarted.gemini.com/20in2020/) covers a broad range of topics — from blockchain 101 to crypto custody to what to look for in a crypto exchange — to help you further engage with the asset class. Here are a few of our favorites:\n \n__What is crypto?__\n\nCrypto is a form of currency built for the internet. It's powered by the blockchain, which is a technology that allows transactions to be recorded, and is very difficult to reverse.   \n \n__Can you tell me more about blockchain?__\n\nA blockchain is a list of records, called blocks, that make up a public blockchain ledger. Each block includes transaction data and is linked to the previous block by a cryptographic hash, making it very difficult to reverse. Blockchain is the underlying technology that ensures the accuracy of accounting, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin run on top of this technology.\n  \n__What are the global benefits of crypto?__\n\nBlockchain networks give people unprecedented access to credit, secure financial products, and spending power for both physical and digital goods. Crypto also allows people to transfer their funds globally and almost instantaneously, without high transaction fees.\n \n__What are stablecoins and how do they remain stable?__\n\nStablecoins are issued to customers in exchange for a specified currency at a fixed exchange rate. The specified currency can be a fiat (like the U.S. Dollar), a cryptocurrency (like bitcoin), or a commodity (like gold). Stablecoins remain stable because of the fixed exchange rate and the stability of the underlying currency. The Gemini dollar is pegged to the U.S. Dollar meaning you can exchange one Gemini dollar for one U.S. Dollar.\n\n__How can I get started in crypto?__\n- Buy it on a regulated cryptocurrency exchange.\n- Find peer to peer freelance opportunities that pay in crypto.\n- Use a bitcoin ATM.\n \n__What should I look for in a secure exchange?__\n- Does the exchange have a regulated Know Your Customer (KYC) process?\n- Is the exchange/custodian organized as a Trust company?\n- Does the exchange have insurance on both online and offline wallets, and how much of your funds will it cover?\n- What is the exchange's approach to security?\n- Who is on the exchange leadership team?  \n\n__What is crypto custody?__\n\nThink of custody as a digital safe deposit box for your crypto. Custodying crypto, as opposed to storing other assets like cash, requires a new class of digital-first infrastructure. Custody solutions come in two forms, which are often referred to as online (“hot wallets”) or offline (“cold storage”) systems. The key difference between the two is whether the storage system is networked or in any way remotely operable.  \n\nOur three-part series covers the most important factors to consider when choosing how, why, and with whom to store your crypto for optimal safety and security: \n\n1. [The Three Tiers of Securely Storing Your Crypto Assets](https://gemini.com/blog/the-three-tiers-of-securely-storing-your-crypto-assets)\n2. [Understanding Institutional-Grade Crypto Custody](https://gemini.com/blog/understanding-institutional-grade-crypto-custody)\n3. [Questions and Considerations for Crypto Custodians](https://gemini.com/blog/questions-and-considerations-for-crypto-custodians)\n\n__How can I help secure my account?__\n\nHackers continue to build sophisticated methods to target online accounts. One of the more common attacks is called SIM swapping, when an unauthorized individual tricks a mobile carrier into switching an existing phone number to a different device. The unauthorized individual can then intercept texts and calls, including two-factor authentication (2FA) confirmations sent via SMS. To help prevent this type of attack, consider switching to app-based 2FA such as the Authy app.\n\n__Where can I use crypto in 2020?__\n\nThere is a growing list of companies that accept it as a form of payment.\n- AMC\n- Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond\n- Expedia\n- Nordstrom\n- OKCupid\n- Petco\n- And more...\n\n__How can I continue learning more about crypto?__\n\nSome of the best resources are news outlets, newsletters, podcasts, and books:\n\n- __Books:__ *Bitcoin Billionaires*, Ben Mezrich.

(Missed part one? Read [What is KYC and Why does it Matter for Cryptocurrency Buyers](https://gemini.com/blog/what-is-kyc-and-why-does-it-matter)).\n\nNot sure what we might need? Feel like you submitted all your information, but you haven’t yet been fully verified to trade and or withdraw from your account? Here is a checklist to help move you through onboarding.\n\n__What does Gemini require and collect?__ \nWhen customers sign up for a Gemini account, applicable regulations require us to collect: full legal name, date of birth, address, phone number, social security number and email.__ Additional documentation is required to be fully verified and to withdraw from the exchange__. Those documents include: \n\n- __U.S. residents:__ A valid passport or driver's license.\n- __International residents:__ Depending on your country of residence, we will require at least two government-issued documents: a valid passport, a driver’s license, and/or a national identity card.\n- __Canadian residents:__ A valid passport, driver’s license, and social insurance number. \n\n__Haven’t heard from us? __\n- Add our email address to your favorites! To make sure we’re hitting your inbox with important updates, please make sure our email address, __hello@gemini.com__, is added to your ‘Primary’ inbox. \n- We only communicate about account updates via email - check your spam folder if you can’t find us.\n\n__Having trouble submitting documentation? __\n- When you are submitting documentation, make sure it is of clear quality, not cut off and not missing any information. The ID must be fully readable and unobstructed.\n- Photo ID = driver’s license or state issued ID (US or Canada only) or passport. \n- Make sure your ID is valid and not expired.\n- For security reasons, we do not accept emails with photo ID attachments.  Please submit all documents through  http://exchange.gemini.com/upload.\n- When asked for “proof of address,” we require a full-page scan of a utility, cable or cell phone bill, or a bank statement.\n- Please make sure the document displays your full name, current residential address, and is dated no more than 90 days from the day you submit.\n\n__Having trouble withdrawing from your Gemini account?__\n- In order to enable withdrawals from your account, we will have had to first verify your identity. If we weren’t able to verify your identity because your ID isn’t legible, you will be notified via email and asked to re-upload a clear image of your ID to http://exchange.gemini.com/upload. \n- Once we’ve completed the review process, you’ll receive an email notification on the status of your account.\n\n__Having issues with 2-factor authentication? How do I verify my phone number?__\n- Gemini requires 2-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to verify their phone number and to protect against risks related to number-hijacking (also known as “SIM porting”). \n- We recommend using Authy, a mobile app specifically for 2FA, to generate unique codes each time you login to your Gemini account.  \n- We recommend disabling the multi-device option to safeguard your Authy account even if your phone number is targeted by a successful phone porting attack.\n- In order to verify your account, you will receive a notification from Authy that is similar to notifications you receive from other apps and will ask you to confirm your phone directly. You may not be able to get these notifications unless you go into your settings and allow notifications from the Authy app. \n- When a Gemini user that has an Authy account says they're not getting the code via text to verify their phone during the KYC process, we send this: “We have reviewed your account and it appears the code is being sent directly to your Authy app on your mobile device.” \n\nCryptocurrency is fast maturing as an asset class. Customers choosing an exchange and custodian should think long-term about what the provider brings to the table, how they safeguard your assets and information, and how they comply with traditional financial rules and regulations. The KYC process is meant to increase customer protections, safeguard our exchange and provide for an overall healthy market.\n\nTo complete the signup process today click __[here](https://geminiexchange.app.link/LjSeDCcMF3)__.  \n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nNoah B.

Today we start with the basics of Know Your Customer (KYC) rules and why they are necessary. *\n\nThoughtful regulation is necessary to create healthy markets and is a win-win for the cryptocurrency market and regulators alike. Gemini has four key pillars that drive all our decisions: Security, Licensing, __Compliance__ and Product. These pillars help us build trust, both in the market of the future, and in Gemini.\n\nGemini has followed the compliance and regulatory safeguards put in place by regulators for the traditional financial markets since our launch. Executing KYC procedures on all our customers is a part of those safeguards and incredibly important to maintain our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and associated Anti-Money Laundering regulations.\n\n__KYC__ is how financial institutions verify a customer’s identity, making sure they aren’t on any prohibited sanctions lists and helps to ensure criminals do not use financial institutions for money laundering.\n\n__What are the benefits of going through the KYC process?__ The safety of your personal funds is one of our top priorities and so is keeping bad actors off our platform. This doesn't just serve our customers and Gemini, it helps the health of the entire cryptocurrency industry and maintaining the integrity of the financial system. \n\n__Our Regulatory responsibility and obligations:__ Gemini is a trust company and Qualified Custodian chartered by the New York State Department of Financial Services. To keep our license, we are required to verify the identity of our customers. We also must adhere to strict governance and procedures regarding how we store and use your personal information for your safety and security as well as our liability. Gemini is audited regularly to make sure we are complying with these procedures. \n\n__How will your personal data be used?__ The information you submit is used to verify your identity.

We were the first exchange and custodian in the world to complete both a [SOC 2 Type 1](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian) examination, and a [SOC 2 Type 2](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-completes-soc-2-type-2-examination-another-first-in-crypto) examination, demonstrating our level of security compliance in protecting customer data and funds. SOC 2 certification means that an independent auditor has confirmed that Gemini’s systems are set up to ensure security, availability, and confidentiality of customer data. The SOC 2 Type 2 examination requires Gemini to comply with more stringent specification in how we store and protect data.

We believe that consumers will continue the migration away from physical wallets to digital wallets on their phones and in the future will benefit from pass-through merchant cost savings when paying with crypto.\n\nEnabling consumers to convert their cash to crypto in-stores is a critical step to remove barriers to entry for everyday consumers to benefit from the advantages of cryptocurrency, the convenience of digital wallets, and cheaper payments.\n\nIf you are a merchant interested in incorporating cash-in and/or crypto payments, please email bizdev@gemini.com.

As we look ahead, there is little doubt that the next one — the 2020s — will be ‘the decade of crypto.’ As the sun sets on the last 10 years, which ushered in Bitcoin and crypto as we know it, it is with great pride that we look back on 2019 and with great excitement that we look forward to what’s to come.\n\nIt’s been more than [four years](https://gemini.com/blog/geminis-4th-birthday) since we launched the Gemini Spaceship into the great, beautiful unknown. While our voyage has covered much ground, it is just beginning. While our mission — __*to*__ __*empower the individual through crypto*__ — has accomplished much, it is far from over.\n\n2019 has been a building year for both Gemini and our industry. Despite a crypto winter that has persisted for more than two years, we have stayed focused on quietly laying the foundation for the next wave of use-cases and mainstream adoption. Below are some of our 2019 highlights: \n\n- [Gemini Custody™](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-custody) - we expanded our Qualified Custodian offering to support 18 cryptos (more to come in 2020). We introduced new features, such as Instant Liquidity, which allows you to instantly trade your crypto held in custody on our exchange without waiting for it to be transferred out of cold storage.\n- [State Street Pilot](https://gemini.com/blog/state-street-and-gemini-launch-digital-asset-pilot) - we were selected by State Street for its new digital asset pilot. As part of the pilot, financial institutions can now custody their digital assets with Gemini Custody™ and receive reporting and holdings information via State Street.\n- [SOC 2](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian)  - we completed a SOC 2 Type 1 examination and are currently undergoing a SOC 2 Type 2 examination.\n- [Sub-Accounts](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-subaccounts-for-institutions) - we released sub-accounts which allow you to  create and manage multiple accounts with distinct sets of users, account balances, and unique crypto addresses all under a single master account.\n- [Gemini Clearing™](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-clearing)- we launched a fully-electronic clearing and settlement solution for off-exchange or over-the-counter (OTC) crypto trades.\n- [SEN Network](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-joins-the-silvergate-exchange-network) - we joined the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which allows our institutional customers to deposit and withdraw U.S. dollars 24/7/365.\n- __Index Inclusion__ - we [joined](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-will-join-the-cme-cf-bitcoin-reference-rate-brr-and-cme-cf-bitcoin-real-time-index-brti) the CME CF Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) and CME CF Bitcoin Real Time Index (BRTI). We also [joined](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-joins-the-bitmex-indexes) the Bitmex .BXBT and .BETH indexes.\n- Global Expansion - we launched in [Australia](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-launches-in-australia) and hired Julian Sawyer to lead our expansion into the UK and Europe in 2020 — get ready! \n- __New Hires__ - we welcomed a new [Chief Security Officer](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-welcomes-david-damato-as-chief-security-officer) and [Chief Compliance Officer](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-welcomes-noah-perlman-as-chief-compliance-officer) aboard the Gemini Spaceship.\n- [Gemini Chicago](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-opens-chicago-office-to-meet-growing-institutional-demand) - we opened an office in Chicago. If you are interested in joining us in Chicago, New York, or Portland, Oregon, check out our [careers page](https://gemini.com/careers).\n- [Nifty Gateway™](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-expands-into-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-with-nifty-gateway-tm) - We made our first acquisition! We believe that art and collectibles on the blockchain — in the form of non-fungible tokens or ‘nifities’ — will become a significant medium of expression and creativity. Nifty Gateway™ is user-friendly a bridge into this new world.\n- [Advancing Payments](https://gemini.com/blog/flexa-and-gemini-partner-to-make-it-easy-to-use-cryptocurrency) - we partnered with Flexa so that you can spend your Gemini dollars and other cryptos at select retailers across the country. We also teamed up with [BitPay](https://gemini.com/blog/paying-bills-with-gemini-dollars), the largest global blockchain payments provider, so that you can pay your bills with Gemini dollars.\n- [Virtual Commodity Association](https://gemini.com/blog/vca-working-towards-sro-designation-stands-up-six-committees-to-help-protect-americas-crypto) - we participated as members in helping the VCA stand up six committees focused on topics such as custody, insurance, and market integrity. Our Head of Risk, Yusuf Hussain, was appointed President of the VCA’s Board of Directors.\n\nToday, crypto is still a niche technology and form of money. It is not crucial to your everyday life the way email and other web applications are, but our thesis is that this will change — it’s already changing if you look close enough. This is because crypto makes decentralization possible, which is to say its raison d'etre and center of gravity is the empowerment of the individual.\n\nWithin this decade, crypto will redesign the Internet, the financial system, and money in a way that fosters and protects the rights and dignity of the individual. This means it will make as great of a contribution to your personal freedom as the invention of the printing press, the personal computer, and the early Internet.\n\nThat’s progress and ultimately why crypto will work. It is too fair to ignore; its gravitational pull, too strong to deny. When given the choice, you will choose more freedom, not less. And that’s why you, and everyone else, will choose crypto.\n\nHere’s to the 2020s...the future is you.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler + Cameron","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4aF2A7MBABdhksMdFSn8Ox","blogIntroduction":"Gemini Gives Back started as an employee-led initiative in 2017 by members of #TeamGemini who wanted to give back to the local community.","datePublished":"Dec 27, 2019","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"2019-a-year-of-giving-back","title":"2019: A Year of Giving Back","blogAuthors":[{"id":"1KJAj64qRrWcgzymD1UI5n","authorName":"Marjorie Rainone","authorPosition":"Associate Director of Treasury Operations","intro":"Marjorie Rainone is a Director of Treasury Operations at Gemini and joined in March 2017.

BitPay, the largest global blockchain payments provider, will now make Gemini dollars (GUSD) available to spend through [BitPay’s Business Billing](https://bitpay.com/billing) solution. \n\nSince 2011, BitPay has enabled businesses globally to accept bitcoin and other crypto while settling in their preferred currency. Their solution opens the doors for broader business to business (B2B) acceptance of stablecoin payments.\n\nEarlier this year, Gemini [partnered with Flexa](https://medium.com/gemini/flexa-and-gemini-partner-to-make-it-easy-to-use-cryptocurrency-b9ace9174bcc), a crypto payments network, to drive adoption and day-to-day utility of cryptocurrency. Flexa, via their app called SPEDN, enables users to natively spend their crypto, including the Gemini dollar, in stores at major merchants in the U.S. and Canada such as Nordstrom, Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond, Petco, and GameStop among others. \n\nThe combination of crypto payment acceptance and a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin is powerful. Merchants benefit from faster, cheaper, and fraud resistant payment settlement and consumers benefit from the price stability and creditworthiness of U.S. dollars strengthened by the advantages of regulated, borderless, digital transfer of value.\n\nNatively spending Gemini dollars removes many of the challenges of crypto payments such as price volatility and tax confusion. It also mitigates traditional payment woes such as chargeback risks, long settlement timelines, expensive payment processing, and process opacity. \n\nWe strive to move the cryptocurrency industry forward while building a bridge to the *__future of money__* and are excited that Bitpay has joined the Gemini dollar ecosystem to provide volatility-free payment options for global enterprises. \n\nTo start spending Gemini dollars at supported merchants, deposit Gemini dollars in the [SPEDN app](https://www.spedn.io/) for in-store purchases and in the [BitPay wallet](https://bitpay.com/wallet) for paying bills.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"7Gfff26jVtSX0bbVtdkT4e","blogIntroduction":"Gemini is kicking off this year’s season of giving with #BitcoinTuesday in collaboration with The Giving Block. \n","datePublished":"Dec 03, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":false,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"this-holiday-season-buy-sell-store-and-donate-your-cryptocurrency","title":"This Holiday Season, Buy, Sell, Store, and Donate your Cryptocurrency!","blogAuthors":[{"id":"4JSfYYP5FP7wYoEamDm4qk","authorName":"Kristen Mirabella","authorPosition":"Sales and Relationship Manager ","intro":"Kristen Mirabella is a Director of Business Development at Gemini and joined in March 2018.

This initiative, led by [The Giving Block](https://www.thegivingblock.com/bitcoin-tuesday), rallies the crypto community for the biggest day of international giving. \n\n__How can you participate?__\nJoin us for #BitcoinTuesday in two ways: Donate directly to participating nonprofits through The Giving Block, or trade on the Gemini exchange. We will donate a portion of today’s trading fees, up to $10,000, to The Giving Block’s participating nonprofit organizations.\n\n__Why donate your cryptocurrency?__\nPowered by the Gemini platform, The Giving Block’s donation portal allows nonprofits to efficiently accept donations in the form of crypto. Using an “auto-sell” feature, the portal automatically converts donations of bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, zcash, litecoin, and Gemini dollars to fiat.\n\nDonating a cryptocurrency like bitcoin to 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations is tax deductible* in the United States. You should consult with a tax advisor when calculating the amount for deduction. \n\nGemini is excited to participate in this important day of giving. We hope to encourage members of the crypto community to join us today, and throughout the holiday season, to use crypto as a tool for giving! \n\nVisit [bitcointuesday.org](https://www.thegivingblock.com/bitcoin-tuesday) for more information on #BitcoinTuesday and instructions on how to give.\n\nOnward and Upward, \n\nKristen Mirabella, Sales and Relationship Management  \n \n \n*This article is intended as general guidance and should not be construed as tax or legal advice.

As part of our mission to build the future of money, we are building bridges into these new digital economies. To that end, we have purchased [Nifty Gateway](https://niftygateway.com/#/lwhome)™, a popular platform where you can buy and manage non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\n\n__What is an NFT?__ NFTs — also known as “__nifties__” — many of which follow the [ERC-721](http://erc721.org/) standard for tokens, are cryptographic tokens that represent a unique asset or good on the blockchain. Nifties differ from fungible cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in that each nifty is one-of-a-kind and, therefore, not interchangeable. As a result, nifties are the perfect digital, form factor for crypto-collectibles, crypto-art, and much more.\n\n__Why Nifties?__ There are many collectibles in the “real” world such as stamps, baseball cards, Magic: The Gathering cards, and Tamagotchi pets, to name just a few. There are also examples of digital collectibles inside popular online games such as Fortnite, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, with [multi-billion dollar economies](https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-turning-in-app-virtual-goods-assets/) emerging as players buy and trade skins, dances, and other in-game items. Over time, we believe that both real world and digital collectibles will migrate onto blockchains in the form of nifties.\n\n__Why Nifty Gateway?__ Nifty Gateway provides a simple and easy way to buy nifties with your credit or debit card. Founded by twin brothers [Duncan Cock Foster](https://twitter.com/dccockfoster?lang=en) and [Griffin Cock Foster](https://twitter.com/gcockfoster?lang=en), the platform currently facilitates nifty purchases for some of today’s most popular crypto-games and applications, including [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), and Gods Unchained. Duncan and Griffin’s passion (quite frankly “obsession”) for nifties, crypto, and building intuitive products made them the perfect fit for the Gemini family. Together, the Nifty Gateway platform can leverage Gemini’s brand of security and trust.\n\nTo learn more about Nifty Gateway and buy nifties click [here](https://niftygateway.com/#/lwhome).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler Winklevoss, CEO\n\n","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"1lrWrwGHybpLlJ0u6QEQaj","blogIntroduction":"Today we are excited to announce support for Stop-Limit orders — one of the most requested features from our customers to date!\n","datePublished":"Nov 14, 2019","isLargeFeatured":true,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":false,"showMoreFromAuthors":false,"showLatestNews":false,"slug":"introducing-stop-limit-orders","title":"Introducing Stop-Limit Orders ","blogAuthors":[{"id":"5t5wYeODguQAV9dP6UvwD7","authorName":"Andrew Page","authorPosition":"Product Manager","intro":"Andrew Page is an Associate Director of Product at Gemini and joined in June 2019.","slug":"andrew-page","profileImage":{"id":"26SwfyWOZ6DmyB9vMOzLsc","alt":"Andrew Page-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/26SwfyWOZ6DmyB9vMOzLsc/0006a62c1bb73aa2b307c6a4dbf8a17c/Andrew_Page-Headshot.jpg"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"5bGBol0eQjVr6MWe7gtcyB","alt":"Screen Shot 2019-11-20 at 12.30.42 PM","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/5bGBol0eQjVr6MWe7gtcyB/fd744c134b2bc83ec53d07ceadc92d83/2019-11-07_Stop_Orders-01.png"},"blogPostContent":"Today we are excited to announce support for __Stop-Limit orders__ — one of the most requested features from our customers to date!\n\nStop-Limit orders are typically used by traders to help manage risk and are common in marketplaces for traditional asset classes. Stop-Limit orders give traders more control over order execution and trading strategies. Starting today, __November 14__, you can place buy or sell Stop-Limit orders on all order books using the Gemini ActiveTrader™ interface, as well as our REST and FIX order entry APIs.\n\n__How do Stop-Limit orders work?__\n\nA Stop-Limit order has a Stop Price, a Side, and a Limit Price. When the Last Trade Price crosses the Stop Price on either the order book or the Gemini Auction, a Limit order will be placed on the Side at the Limit Price associated with the order.\n\n__Example 1: Protecting a BTC Position__\n\nLet’s say Thomas bought 0.1 BTC when the BTC/USD market was trading at $10,000 on Gemini. Thomas wants to protect his trade from potential loss in the event the BTC/USD market price declines. He might enter an order like this:\n\n- Order Type: Stop-Limit\n- Quantity: 0.1 BTC\n- Side: Sell\n- Stop Price: $9,000.00\n- Limit Price: $8,500.00\n\nOnce this Stop-Limit order has been placed, he can view his order in the Open Orders table in his ActiveTrader interface. In the event the market price declines from $10,000 to $9,000, a Limit sell 0.1 BTC at $8,500.00 order will be placed on the BTC/USD order book.\n\nBecause that order is placed when the market crosses $9,000, Thomas’s order will get filled at or above his Limit Price of $8,500 depending on the liquidity on the BTC/USD order book at that time.\n\nThe Limit Price of the order protects Thomas from selling his position at a price less than he intended (i.e., $8,500).\n\nThe benefit of placing a Stop-Limit order in this example is that the Limit sell order is automatically placed when the Stop Price is triggered. Order placement that is conditional on market price means you don’t have to be in front of a screen at the time the order is placed.\n\n__Example 2: Entering a BTC Position__\n\nThis is an example of using a Stop-Limit order as part of a trading strategy involving resistance levels.\n\nLet’s say the BTC/USD market is trading at $10,000. Thomas wants to buy BTC, but he only wants to buy in the event of an uptrend, after the market price exceeds a resistance level of $10,500. Thomas may enter an order like this:\n\n- Order Type: Stop-Limit\n- Quantity: 0.1 BTC\n- Side: Buy\n- Stop Price: $10,500.00\n- Limit Price: $11,000.00\n\nThomas is not exposed to downside risk associated with holding the BTC position before this resistance level has been exceeded.\n\n__More information on Stop-Limit orders:__ \n\n- Reference documentation about Gemini order types can be found [here](https://gemini.com/fees/marketplace#order-types)\n- REST API details surrounding order entry for Stop-Limit orders can be found [here](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#order-placement-apis)\n- FIX API details surrounding order entry for Stop-Limit orders can be found [here](https://docs.gemini.com/fix-api/)\n- To access Stop-Limit orders in ActiveTrader™, please go [here](https://exchange.gemini.com/signin)\n- Gemini ActiveTrader™ is a trading view that offers advanced charting, improved trading pair selectors, and deeper order book visibility.

It allows instant and trustless peer-to-peer transacting while limiting the amount of data needed on-chain. You can read more about how it works in our post [here](https://medium.com/gemini/breaking-down-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-eltoo-c48554f5ae02).\n\nAny two individuals on the Lightning Network can transact without needing a direct payment channel open with one-another. The sender does not directly pay the intended recipient; instead, they pay a user with whom they _do_ have a channel open. That user sends a payment to another such user, and so on until the intended recipient receives their payment.\n\nBut why are users along the way incentivized to help the sender route the payment, and how does the sender make sure these users can’t steal any of the Bitcoin intended for the recipient? The answer is with **H**ashed **T**ime **L**ocked **C**ontracts ([HTLCs](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)), which I will explore in this post.\n\n**HTLCs and Routing Payments**\n\nHTLCs are a clever way to trustlessly route payments in the Lightning Network. As the name suggests, they involve hashes, timelocks, and function as a contract between users in the Lightning Network.\n\nAlice, Bob, and Charlie each run a lightning node. Alice has a channel open with Bob, and Bob has a channel open with Charlie. Alice and Charlie do not have a channel open directly with one another.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*A4cu-Hdh7qi8KSZC)\n*Alice has a channel open with Bob, who also has one open with Charlie*\n\nAlice wants to pay Charlie 1 bitcoin. The first thing Charlie does is create a secret number **_R_** that he does not share with anyone.\n\nCharlie places **_R_** into a **_cryptographic hash function_** and records the output. In short, when you place a number into a hash function, it produces a unique output. The design goal of a hash function is such that if you have the output of a hash function, there’s no way to figure out what the input was.\n\nCharlie takes the output of hashing **_R_**, we’ll call this new number **H**, and sends it to Alice. Note that Alice does not know **_R_** — she only knows **H**_,_ which conceals the value of **_R_**.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*4YWNK1IAnURrL7EF)\n*Charlie sends Alice H, the result of hashing his secret number R.*\n\nThe Lightning Network is named as such because while Alice and Charlie may not have a payment channel open directly with one-another, a route exists between them in the _network_ of users. Alice sees that a payment route to Charlie exists through Bob, so to pay Charlie, Alice must involve Bob.\n\nAlice sends Bob a transaction for 1.1 bitcoin that Bob can redeem _if he finds out_ **_R_**.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*1xfD4-HxFakNB1Dp)\n*Alice sends Bob a signed transaction in their payment channel that would pay him 1.1 bitcoin if he can prove he knows R.*\n\nShe signs this transaction and sends it to Bob. At a high level, here’s what the new output might look like:\n\n...\nOP_IF\n\n#Make sure the value provided equals H when hashed\n\nOP_HASH160 H OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\nOP_CHECKSIG # This branch only works if Bob signs it\n\nOP_ELSE\n\n#If Bob doesn't figure out R in X days, Alice can claim this\n\n#output using her signature alone.\n\n...\n\nOP_ENDIF\n\nOP_HASH160 H OP_EQUALVERIFY\n\nThis part of script:\n\n1\\. Takes whatever value you provide it\n\n2\\. Hashes it\n\n3\\. Pushes _H_, the concealed secret, onto the stack\n\n4\\. Compare H with the result of 2.\n\nAs you can see, only the secret Charlie knows, **_R_**, will make this part of the script work. Bob does not know **_R_**, so he has no way of claiming this 1.1 bitcoin for himself right now.\n\nBob knows that Charlie knows **_R_**, and he knows how much Alice promised to pay Charlie. Bob, who has a channel open directly with Charlie, creates the **same kind of transaction with Charlie!**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*60WJJVzVHxkWhaYC)\n*Bob sends Charlie a signed transaction in their payment channel that would pay him 1 bitcoin if he proves he knows R.*\n\nOnce again, the locking script on Bob’s signed transaction might look like:\n\n…  \nOP\\_IF  \n#Make sure the value provided equals H when hashed  \nOP\\_HASH160 H OP\\_EQUALVERIFY  \nOP\\_CHECKSIG # This branch only works if CHARLIE signs it  \nOP\\_ELSE  \n#If Charlie doesn’t claim this in X days, Bob can claim this  \n#output using his signature alone.  \n  …  \nOP\\_ENDIF\n\nInstead of being for 1.1 bitcoin, Bob signs a transaction that will give 1 bitcoin of Bob’s own money to Charlie _if Charlie knows_ **_R_**.\n\nWhen Charlie sees that the amount Bob’s transaction would pay him is the amount he expected to receive from Alice, he signs a transaction claiming that output. As we have seen, to claim the output Bob created, you must provide **_R_** as an input to your transaction. **Because the Bitcoin blockchain is public, when Charlie publishes his transaction claiming the output, he has revealed _R_ to the world!**\n\nBob, seeing Charlie has published a transaction claiming the output he created, finds **_R_** from the _witness_ (also called the _unlocking script_) Charlie used to claim the output. Having **_R_**, Bob can now claim the 1.1 Bitcoin from the output Alice created.\n\n**What happened here?**\n\nIn the end, Alice pays Bob 1.1 bitcoin, and Bob pays Charlie 1.0 Bitcoin. The extra .1 bitcoin that Bob keeps is the reason he agrees to help Alice in the first place: he earns a _fee_ in routing the transaction. Whenever someone wants to pay someone else on the Lightning Network, they must account for a small fee that every node collects along the way.\n\nCharlie will only claim the output from Bob if it is for the amount Alice promised him. If Bob sneakily tried to net _half_ of Alice’s bitcoin by sending Charlie a transaction that would only give him .5 bitcoin by revealing **_R_**, Charlie would simply not reveal **_R_**.\n\nThe pursuit of **_R_** is why nodes are invested in routing Alice’s payment to her intended recipient successfully. When **_R_** is publicly visible on the blockchain, it can mean only one thing: Charlie was paid in full. When that happens, all the users along the way can claim their output entitling them to a small fee.\n\nFor simplicity, this example assumes everyone claims their bitcoin by closing their payment channels. In reality, Charlie could reveal **_R_** directly to Bob, who could then show Alice he knows **_R_** as well. Alice, seeing that Bob knows **_R_** (which means Charlie can claim his money at any point), could then send Bob a new transaction for 1.1 bitcoin in their payment channel without any strings attached. Bob could then do the same with Charlie for 1 bitcoin. All three of them can keep their payment channels open this way, and have less clutter on the Bitcoin blockchain whenever they decide to publish the transactions.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"30zvYeXbrnw8RTfCUhIY8U","blogIntroduction":"In the final blog of our three-part blog series on crypto custody, we focus on questions and considerations for customers when choosing a cr...","datePublished":"Oct 07, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"questions-and-considerations-for-crypto-custodians","title":"Questions and Considerations for Crypto Custodians","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"},{"id":"EWqrVIYL52dpkwfQTAd5p","type":"Industry"},{"id":"4dk7En4Vkfx22asnm4Fd30","type":"Institutional"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"nthnDOxs3q9BLE0nqykmc","alt":"027 Questions and Considerations for Crypto Custodians","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/nthnDOxs3q9BLE0nqykmc/171c08dbb2adc71550a47697efba4aaf/2019-09-30_CustodyWhitepaper3-01.png"},"blogPostContent":"_In the final blog of our three-part blog series on crypto custody, we focus on_ **_questions and considerations_** _for customers when choosing a crypto custodian. (Missed part one or part two?

For the time being though, it’s largely cryptocurrency investors who must consider security, alongside other features and capabilities, when selecting one or more custody providers. Some of the chief considerations for customers today are summarized below:\n\n*   **Liquidity:** The speed at which customers want to access funds must be balanced with security concerns around transaction verification. If, for example, an asset movement request can be handled ultra fast, how “offline” or geographically distributed is the system, really? However, if the provider has instant trading capabilities from offline storage while maintaining the full operation process around transaction verification, you can have the benefits of getting into the market quickly, without compromising on security.\n*   **Scalability:** Institutional customers should consider how a custodian’s solutions can support their growing activity and need for additional services over time. For example, are there sub-accounting tools for multi-strategy accounts, how does whitelisting work, and how are new account holders verified, background-checked, and onboarded?\n*   **Fees:** Rather than seek out a solution based on initial sticker prices, customers can consider how well a given solution meets their needs and how its price model aligns with the security, features, and value delivered. Does the custodian require an initial set up fee, are there minimum holdings required to custody assets, or how might fees scale as assets increase?\n*   **Leadership:** A company’s senior leaders should not have the ability to access or move funds. Asking about leadership’s role in system governance can help customers understand how a custody provider ensures there is no single point of failure. Asking how governance process changes are made and who has access to those processes can confirm changes are not done in isolation, potentially eliminating risk associated with a single person gaining unauthorized control of your cryptocurrency.\n*   **Monitoring and Change Management:** A best in-class system should be continually assessed and enhanced in a methodological way. Knowing what mechanisms are in place for visiting sites and auditing equipment could be essential for understanding upgrades and staff rotations. Along those lines, customers should ask about controls applied for the testing and certification of site-by-site performance.\n*   **Licensing and Audits:** Many providers of crypto custody solutions operate without a license, which can leave customers open to many risks. Even among licensed providers, there are key differences in the type of license and that granting jurisdiction. In which state is the custody provider licensed? Does the license require capital reserve requirements, follow general banking standards, and fiduciary duties to customers? Customers should also ask who audits the company, what’s their general approach to compliance?\n*   **Insurance:** The insurance market for cryptocurrency is highly limited today, and even the most robust policies available are limited in terms of amount and incidents covered. Customers should understand how their funds are insured relative to the overall coverage carried by a provider, and make sure to not be oversold on the value of a providers coverage.\n*   **Security:** In part two of our blog series we examined [institutional-grade custody solutions](https://medium.com/gemini/understanding-institutional-grade-crypto-custody-43a2b96e9087). Infrastructure and operational frameworks that help ensure the safety and security of where and how your cryptocurrency is being stored and moved are key.\n\nCryptocurrency is fast maturing as an asset class and customers choosing a custody provider should think long-term about what the provider brings to the table.

Our founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, built Gemini because of their strong belief in the potential of Bitcoin. They launched Gemini because the industry needed a safe and regulated way for people to engage with an entirely new asset class, which then was mostly unknown. We started small; the founding team was a handful of people in a tiny office west of Madison Square Park in what is now dubbed “Crypto Alley”. Fast forward to today, we are a global organization with more than 200 incredibly talented employees, reaching customers in the United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and many more jurisdictions soon.\n\nWhen I joined Winklevoss Capital in 2013, Cameron and Tyler were focused on investing and empowering the early entrepreneurs that were pioneering the crypto market. Bitcoin 2013 — one of the first crypto conferences — was taking place in San Jose, California. The auditorium was filled with Bitcoin enthusiasts who were on a journey to build the future. They were the risk takers, the misfits, the futurists and innovators. It was an underground audience, a movement and a moment in history. It was the beginning of crypto and of Gemini. \\[Read more about the early days in Ben Mezrich’s [Bitcoin Billionaires](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Billionaires-Genius-Betrayal-Redemption/dp/1250217741)\\]. So much has evolved since then.\n\nIn 2014, there weren’t many HODLERs let alone bitcoin spenders (aside from a couple of [Virgin Galactic](https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/twins-space) tickets and the infamous bitcoin pizza). At a SXSW conference in 2015, we could barely give away bitcoin to the audience — but four years later, nearly everyone at the conference was a proud owner.\n\nGemini’s journey, and my own journey, has been an evolution. However, our DNA has never changed. It took us a year and a half, before we launched, to obtain our **Trust License** (note: not BitLicense) from the New York Department of Financial Services. Our values still hold true: act with the highest integrity, have conviction, and play for the long game. It was always our ethos to _ask for permission, rather than forgiveness_. To be a member of the founding team on an extraordinary mission to **_build the future of money_** has been incredible.\n\nSince regulation, security, and compliance are three of our founding pillars, our first hires were our Chief Compliance Officer, followed by our Chief Security Officer, then our VP of Engineering. They all remain a part of the Gemini family today. Over the years, we have continued to make [key hires](https://medium.com/gemini/tagged/announcements) that align with our values and embody the Gemini way.\n\nGemini’s key milestones would never have been possible without the individuals that have joined us on our mission, and the people outside of Gemini who believe in the potential of crypto. An organization is only as strong as its people, and it’s people who will collectively improve money and a centuries old financial industry — building, creating, and innovating the future of finance in a safe and secure manner.

(Missed part one? Read about the three tiers of crypto custody_ [_here_](https://medium.com/gemini/the-three-tiers-of-securely-storing-your-crypto-assets-8afa9d256163)_.)_\n\n**Part Two: Institutional-Grade Crypto Custody**\n\nThird-party custody solutions come in two forms, which are often referred to as online (“hot wallets”) or offline (“cold storage”) systems. The difference between the two amounts to whether the storage system is networked or in any way remotely operable. Online solutions are capable of greater speed and liquidity, but can be more vulnerable to attacks. Offline solutions are generally slower to execute on customer instructions because their private key-storage systems can only be accessed at their physical locations, however, there is usually lower risk of unauthorized transfers.\n\nAn offline, third-party custody solution is the most robust approach for customers seeking both security and trust, but not all offline solutions deliver institutional-grade protections. Customers should understand how custody solutions work in order to know which attributes and components matter most for their specific needs and concerns.\n\nBelow are important infrastructure and operational attributes of an institutional-grade solution:\n\n*   **Secure Vaulting:** For optimal security, a custody provider should be storing key devices in high-security facilities. Multiple, redundant high-security storage locations and geographically distributed backup sites are necessary for institutional custody providers. Access to secure facilities should be limited to only authorized personnel using multiple forms of identity authentication such as ID badges and biometric scans (e.g. fingerprint).\n*   **Cryptographic Hardware:** Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are physical computing devices that protect and store cryptographic secrets, including the private keys required for signing a transaction. The most secure HSMs meet the highest levels of the U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) security ratings. If an offline solution uses HSM devices of a certain caliber, the cryptographic secrets on those HSMs cannot be extracted even if the devices were authenticated to in an authorized way. This ensures the private key remains onboard the HSM in perpetuity and no copies can be made — in secret — for use at a later time.\n*   **Organization Governance and Controls:** It is not enough for a storage center to be offline; human governance and role separation controls must work together for effective security design. The instructions issuance process and governance controls are almost as important as how securely keys are stored. The funds movement process for custodying cryptocurrency needs to be designed in a way that diffuses the level of control among parties and ensures that no single party can take over or corrupt that process.\n*   **Redundancy and Business Continuity:** Maintaining multiple, redundant storage locations and geographically distributed backup sites is necessary for institutional-grade custody providers. Having at least two layers of redundancy is important to maintaining operations in the event of natural disasters or the destruction of property.\n*   **Transparency and Proof of Controls:** Visibility into custody services is more important to certain investors than others, depending on factors such as size of holdings, privacy preferences, and other variables. For some customers, it’s important to have tools that allow them to easily access and view their holdings in order to confirm their provider is custodying what they claim. Custody providers should regularly self-test and engage in audits of their systems and controls (e.g. SOC 2 certification).\n\nCustody solutions that can be considered institutional-grade are not just “air-gapped” computers in protected physical locations. They combine at least secure vaulting, cryptographic hardware, and organizational governance to provide multiple layers of security for the safeguarding of assets.\n\nIn part three of the series we will focus on questions and considerations when choosing a crypto custodian.

In this three-part series, we will cover the most important factors to consider when choosing how, why, and who to store your crypto with for optimal safety and security. Today we start with the basics, the_ **_three tiers of crypto custody_**_._\n\n**Part One: The Basic Tiers of Crypto Custody**\n\nCrypto Custody is a broad term that can be applied to a number of different solutions for cryptocurrency storage. People have many choices when it comes to storing their crypto, and the connectivity of those solutions poses unique concerns for customers. Solutions range from self-custody options like a hardware or software wallet, to third-party, offline storage.\n\nCustodying cryptocurrency (such as bitcoin, litecoin, ether, and many others), as opposed to other assets like cash, securities, or objects, requires a new kind of infrastructure — one that differs from the traditional paper-and-safe approach in banking.\n\nCustody needs also vary. For instance, some investors might need to infrequently access or move their cryptocurrency compared to others who trade more frequently. Some investors might prefer to self-custody, while some institutions might require a third-party solution. There are three tiers of crypto custody available.\n\n1\\. **Self-custody: Build your own solution**\n\nThere are many ways to self-secure cryptocurrencies. Approaches can range from using consumer hardware wallets, to creating complex setups for the duplication, storage, and backup of your printed-out private keys (private keys are akin to your “password” — they allow you to access your crypto funds).\n\nMany people want complete control of their cryptocurrency, and self-custodying provides a good solution. However, consider the difficulty in managing passwords and the frequency with which you may have a password reset performed. When dealing with self-storage and private keys there are no resets, a lost key is gone forever. Self-custodying, like keeping cash in your physical wallet or locked in drawer, poses its own risks. There is no third-party involved to manage that risk (or your funds) if you were to lose access to your keys, experience a destructive event like a fire or power outage, or pass away unexpectedly.\n\nHolders should consider their access to software updates, as well as their personal capacity to correctly backup, restore, and implement geographic redundancy. Individuals should also consider how family members or intended beneficiaries would recover funds in emergency situations.\n\n2\\. **Partial custody: “Wallet plus” solution**\n\nAn emerging option in the cryptocurrency custody market is a self-managed wallet that offers some level of third-party assistance and related institutional controls or protections. Such an option may align to the needs of certain retail or high-net-worth investors who want to control their holdings, but also desire some level of assurance and institutional protections shy of full third-party management.\n\n“Wallet plus” solutions scale up from basic hardware wallets by applying protocols such as two-factor authentication (or other identity verifications) and/or basic multisignature protections, where the third-party possess a key for co-signing the customer’s transactions.\n\nThis amounts to a form of split or partial custody, in which the customer and the third party are generally required to cooperate as part of the signing process. However, the exact amount of control either party has to sign the transaction without the other party — such as in the event of an emergency — depends both on the legal arrangement between customer and provider and the specific key management model of the custody solution.\n\nCustomers should consider (and ask about) the potential for third-party access and/or movement of their funds without their key. They should also be mindful of how a “wallet plus” provider handles software upgrades and practical concerns such as backup, recovery, and identity verification.\n\n3\\. **Third-party custody: Managed solution**\n\nThird-party custody solutions allow customer funds to be held and managed entirely by a solutions provider. The user entrusts their assets to the custody provider, who is then the only entity acting on the customer’s instructions (the customer is not involved as a direct signing authority). Service level agreements (SLAs) dictate the terms and timing conditions regarding the storage, access, and movement of customer funds by the third party.\n\nThird-party solutions are best suited to investors and institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and/or high-net-worth individuals. They are the only solutions capable of offering bank-level protection for crypto security and safety, as they provide the most robust level of third-party control. That said, third-party custody solutions in the market today vary drastically in terms of what they offer (as we’ll discuss in part two of this blog series).\n\nCustomers also have the option to use multiple third parties (full-custody or wallet-plus) if they want two or more providers involved to verify instructions and move funds.\n\nWe know that there are a lot of products out there that market security, or offer low fees. We believe a third-party custody solution provided by a Qualified Custodian is the best way for institutions to store cryptocurrency.\n\nKeep a lookout for our next two posts in this series. In part two we will dive deeper into institutional-grade custody solutions. In part three we will focus on questions and considerations when choosing a crypto custodian.\n\nFor more information, download our [Guide to Crypto Custody](http://bit.ly/2kAnkIU).

Following these simple steps will improve your security posture.\n\n### #1: Disable SMS Account Recovery\n\nIf you don’t know if you have this enabled, there’s a good chance you do, and having it enabled is a bad idea. Attackers can get control of your phone number via _phone porting_, where they call your phone carrier, pretend to be you, and ask them to start sending all calls and SMS texts to a phone _they_ own.\n\nIf this happens, and you have SMS account recovery enabled anywhere, the attacker can click **“Forgot password?”,** receive the verification text to _their_ phone, and successfully log in to _your_ email account.\n\nGmail, for example, provides instructions on disabling SMS account recovery [here.](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/183723?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\u0026hl=en\u0026oco=0)\n\n**Note:** There are **many services** that allow SMS account recovery. It is particularly important to remove this option from your email, though, because your email address is often how you can reset passwords for _all_ your sites and services.\n\n### #2: Disable SMS Two-Factor Authentication\n\nFirst, understand that _SMS two-factor authentication_ is different than _SMS account recovery_, which I just described earlier. If you have SMS two-factor authentication turned on, it means that when you log in with your password on a site, that site sends you a text with a one-time code that you need to enter _in addition to your password_ to log in. This is different than _SMS account recovery_, where you click `Forgot Password?` and receive a one-time code to the phone number associated with your account to reset that account’s password. No password is needed in the latter case.\n\nYou should disable SMS two-factor authentication for the same _phone porting_ risk I outlined in point #1.\n\nWhen you remove SMS two-factor authentication, it’s important to add a more secure form of two-factor authentication before signing out. You can add an _authenticator application_ like Authy, Duo, or Google Authenticator. When you use an authenticator app, the secret one-time codes are generated on your _physical device_, rather than texted to your phone number. That means an attacker with control of your phone number still can’t generate the one-time codes needed to log in to your account.\n\nEven better than adding an authenticator app is adding a _security key_, which I describe later.\n\n### #3: Turn off “Multi-Device” Support on your Authenticator App\n\nHowever, some of these apps enable _Multi-device support_, which means you can enroll another device to generate the _exact same codes_ as your current device. This allows you to have a backup device generate codes in case you lose or misplace your primary device.\n\nUnfortunately, how you confirm that you want to add a second device is via _text message_ to the phone number associated with your existing device. Thus, if an attacker has control of your phone number, they can take their phone, enroll it as a backup device for the authenticator app on _your_ phone,  receive the confirmation text, and successfully finish enrolling their phone’s authenticator app as your phone’s backup.\n\nYou can, and should, disable Multi-device support on your authenticator apps. Authy, as an example, explains how to do this [in their support pages](https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016317013-Enable-or-Disable-Authy-Multi-Device).\n\n**Note:** Disabling multi-device support means that if you lose that device, you will have no way of logging in to your accounts (assuming you don’t have backup codes, or another form of two-factor authentication like a security key enabled). However, it also means that if an attacker gets control of your phone number, they have no way of generating these one-time codes, or enrolling their device as a “backup” to your authenticator app.\n\n### #4: Set a Voicemail PIN (or disable it!)\n\nVoicemails are remotely accessible. That means an attacker does not need control of your phone number to listen to your voicemail messages — they just need an internet connection.\n\nWorse yet, some services that allow SMS account recovery allow you to [receive that one-time code via _phone call_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZbTPYB3cU)_._ An automated voice recites the one-time code to you on the call, and if you don’t answer, that recording goes to your voicemail. Thus, even if an attacker doesn’t have control of your phone number, they can click `Forgot password?` on your account, and have the site send the one-time code for reseting your password via phone call to your phone number. If you don’t answer the call (some attackers may wait until you are asleep), and you don’t have a voicemail PIN, the attacker can remotely log in to your voicemail and listen to that one-time code.\n\nTo prevent this attack, set a voicemail PIN on your phone, or call your carrier and disable voicemail on your phone entirely.\n\n### #5: Advanced: Use a Security Key!\nSome people believe that using an authenticator app like Authy or Duo instead of SMS two-factor means they are no longer vulnerable to phishing. This is untrue.\n\nThe issue with one-time numerical codes is that anyone in the world can enter them. Even if those codes can only be generated on your physical device, if you get tricked into sharing that one-time code with a fake website or fake customer support rep, an attacker can quickly use it along with your password to log in to your account from anywhere in the world.\n\nThere’s a solution to this problem called security keys on sites that implement the [WebAuthN](https://gemini.com/blog/securing-your-gemini-account-with-webauthn) standard. A security key is a physical device that provides a cryptographic signature to confirm your identity to a site. Security keys can include:\n• Yubikeys\n• MacOS Touch ID\n• Feitian keys\n• Even more, outlined [here](https://gemini.com/blog/securing-your-gemini-account-with-webauthn).\n\n![0 T0R5pahuH7YBOG3o](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/4wDHB2L9UNBsc0Ktu4M1UQ/5a85568c384b3976390d58d1850a8864/0_T0R5pahuH7YBOG3o.jpeg)\n\n*Examples of security keys, provided by Yubico*\n\nSecurity keys have nothing to do with your phone number. The attacker would need physical access to that security key to try and authenticate as you. There’s no single-use numerical codes involved, so there is nothing you can provide a fake site or a fake customer support rep to log in to your account mistakenly.\nHere’s an example of logging in with MacOS Touch ID to Gemini. After entering your password, Gemini prompts you to use the Touch ID feature of your Mac to complete the log in.\n\n![1 a08Vgf mZBr5Hpya6cyBYg](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/6hCLqhzpuvM0W2gpynFtqe/1f4e754d5a2ac10c61c96aa0ee2e07ee/1_a08Vgf_mZBr5Hpya6cyBYg.png)\n\n*Gemini prompting for Touch ID on MacOS*\n\nGemini became [the world’s first crypto exchange and custodian to support the WebAuthn security protocol](https://gemini.com/blog/securing-your-gemini-account-with-webauthn), which allows the use of security keys for logging in. You can add security keys to your Gemini account like so:\n\n1. Under __My Account__, select __Security Settings__.\n\n![1 M5gwQIIh yM2theOhMG5zA](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/hacyaiEJ8JhC4MVfO7evx/8492c54864b954ba614dc90c57524910/1_M5gwQIIh_yM2theOhMG5zA.png)\n\n2. Scroll down to __Add Security Key__.\n\n![1 JbLL32X03lLrn5Xwmw82BA](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/7ghtmmtG8pdC1hawf0PDa4/e0f51af705b922a0b09f748cd0cbcd97/1_JbLL32X03lLrn5Xwmw82BA.png)\n\n3. Enroll any of the security key options mentioned in the [article above](https://gemini.com/blog/securing-your-gemini-account-with-webauthn).\nIf you enroll at least two security keys, you can then select the __Yes, only use Security Keys__ option. This ensures that you can only sign in to your Gemini account with your password and one of your security keys!\n\n![1 K4eiMYNQq4HmMmBsc UpgA](//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/3ZN0NSG8imqc1fHDtKHAHJ/9b73fbbfb5e367f5b248698e37675f0c/1_K4eiMYNQq4HmMmBsc_UpgA.png)\n\nThese 5 steps will improve your security posture dramatically.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"5j44OOhtPHL6xYzNhFV133","blogIntroduction":"Today, we are excited to introduce Gemini Custody™, a Qualified Custodian for your crypto.

This feature allows our institutional customers to create and manage multiple accounts under a single master account. Sub-accounting is one of the most commonly requested features by our institutional customers and makes **_Gemini the world’s first crypto exchange and custodian to support this feature._**\n\nSub-accounts allow institutions to segregate trading strategies, funds, end customers, and more across multiple sub-accounts under the same master account. They also make it easier for institutions to earn volume-based trading fee discounts because volume for an institution is aggregated across all of its sub-accounts.\n\nWe believe this feature will be very valuable to a variety of our institutional customers, including hedge funds running multiple trading strategies, Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) looking to manage segregated accounts, and retail brokers needing to maintain self-directed accounts for their customers.\n\nHere’s a look at how sub-accounts work and the specific features available:\n\n**1\\. Account and User Management**\n\nUsing either our website interface or API, a master account administrator can create an unlimited number of sub-accounts. Each sub-account can have its own distinct set of users permissioned for specific roles, as well as its own account balance and unique, independently verifiable crypto addresses. A master account administrator can view and perform actions for any user of any sub-account.\n\nUsers can be permissioned at the sub-account level for specific roles on specific sub-accounts or at the master account level for specific privileges across all sub-accounts. See below for some examples.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Nn_zdfMYAjAYRC4CVlOaFQ.png)\n\n_In this example, there are two sub-accounts under the master account. User 1 has Auditor level access to the master account, which confers Auditor privileges on User 1 for all sub-accounts. User 2 only has Trading access to sub-account A, whereas User 3 has Trading access to both sub-accounts A and B. This means that User 2 may only place trades on behalf of sub-account A, whereas User 3 may place trades on behalf of either sub-account A or sub-account B._\n\nRegardless of permissioning, users only need one set of login credentials. Users can easily toggle between different sub-accounts for which they have permissions via our website interface.\n\n**2\\. API Functionality**\n\nAPI keys can be created and permissioned at either the master account level or sub-account level. Master account API keys can manage any sub-account simply by specifying the specific sub-account on which an action is to be performed. Specific sub-account API keys may also be permissioned for specific roles on specific sub-accounts. See below for some examples.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*OnAEaKiJWqhGQxMdZUYojQ.png)\n\n_In this example, Alice, Bob, and Eve are members of a single institution. Alice’s API key has Admin and Auditor permissions at the master account level, whereas Bob’s API key only has Trading access to the ‘Stat Arb’ sub-account and Eve’s API key only has Trading access to the ‘Alpha One Strat’ sub-account._\n\nAll of our existing REST API endpoints are available to master account API keys. For more information, please see our [API Documentation](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/).\n\n**3\\. Instant Fund Transfers Between Sub-accounts**\n\nYou can instantly transfer crypto or fiat currency between sub-accounts at no charge. Such transfers are internal book transfers or “off-chain” and therefore _not_ broadcast to a given blockchain. As a result, they are instant, free, and private — they cannot be viewed by third parties.\n\n**4\\. Aggregation of Volume for Trading Fee Discounts**\n\nWhen we calculate an institution’s volumes for the purposes of volume-based trading fee discounts, we aggregate the trading volume for all of its sub-accounts. This makes it easier for institutions that use sub-accounts for their trading strategies to earn volume-based trading fee discounts.\n\n**5\\. Offer Gemini Services to your Customers**\n\nInstitutions can also use sub-accounts to offer Gemini’s services to their own customers. By creating a sub-account for each of your customers you can custody assets, manage balances, and execute trades or other actions on their behalf.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help getting started with sub-accounts, please contact us at [sales@gemini.com](mailto:sales@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2HrRxaLxpvtIGM7aWU1pnF","blogIntroduction":"Today, we are excited to announce that we have joined the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).

Australians can now download the [Gemini Mobile App](https://geminiexchange.app.link/T1zuzPoZhZ) and use it to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether, zcash, and litecoin.\n\nAs part of our mission to **_build the future of money_**, we are hard at work expanding our global footprint and bringing our trusted platform to as many countries as possible. We want individuals and institutions around the world to have a safe and easy way to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency and engage in this new digital economy. We have built an institutional-grade exchange and custody solution that operates on the principles of security, transparency, and compliance; **_trust is our product_.**\n\nAustralia is currently ranked [12th globally](https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/btc/analysis/USD) for bitcoin trading volume and we are optimistic that Gemini will help encourage broader adoption for crypto in Australia. Today, Gemini is available in a total of 49 U.S. states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and **Australia**! If you would like Gemini to come to your region, please contact us at [institutional@gemini.com](mailto:institutional@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler\n\n\n\n### Introducing Our East Asia Timezone Auction\n\n__March 16, 2017__\n\nUPDATE 4/7/17 5:00 PD EDT: We have changed the time of the East Asian timezone auction from 18:00 JST (17:00 HKT/SGT) to 19:00 HKT/SGT (20:00 JST).\n\nEver since Gemini launched our first daily bitcoin auction on September 21, 2016, we’ve been excited by its success and its ability to match buyers and sellers at a single moment of the day. Because our current 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time auction falls during the early morning hours in East Asia, it’s inconvenient for many members of the bitcoin trading community. Beginning Tuesday, March 21, 2017, we will also conduct an auction at 6:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time (5:00 p.m. SGT/HKT, 09:00 UTC). This will allow investors and traders on the other side of the world to engage in the same kind of price discovery that we’ve be facilitating for the last six months. The mechanics will be the same as our 4:00 p.m. ET auction; please see https://gemini.com/marketplace/#auction for details.\n\nジェミニ(Gemini)が、2016年9月21日に初の日単位でのビットコインのオークションを開始して以来、買い手と売り手のマッチングが、タイミングで成立できていることに、我々はとても興奮させられています。残念ながら、東アジアの参加者にとっては、ニューヨークの午後\n4時は非常に早くて不便です。そこで、2017年3月21日(火)から、日本標準時の午後6時(SGT/HKT午後5時、UTC 09:00)にもオークションを行えるようにします。これにより、\nニューヨークにいる我々からみて、世界の反対側にいる投資家やトレーダー達が、これまでの六ヶ月間我々が手がけてきたものと同等の価格発見に関われるようになるはずです。仕組みは、ニューヨークのオークションのそれと同じです。詳しくは、\nhttps://gemini.com/marketplace/#auctionをご覧ください。\n\nOnward and Upward (上向きと先へ),\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n\n\n### Gemini Expands Into the Great State of Washington\n\n__June 13, 2017__\n\nUPDATE 6/14/17 11:30 AM EDT: We have clarified that Washington’s higher standards are met by the whole Gemini platform and therefore benefit all our customers.\n\nWe’re excited to announce that Gemini is now licensed to provide our services to customers in the Evergreen State. Washington has some of the highest standards of oversight for digital asset exchanges within the U.S., and will be instituting further regulations regarding the sale and storage of digital assets beginning next month. This puts Washington up with New York at the forefront of protecting consumers and users of digital assets, beyond what is already done for fiat currencies.\n\nAs of today, registered customers in the Evergreen State can buy, sell, and store both bitcoin and ether using the Gemini exchange. As a registered customer, this will allow you to:\n\n*   Buy BTC with USD or ETH, and sell BTC for USD or ETH\n*   Buy ETH with USD or BTC, and sell ETH for USD or BTC\n\nOne of Gemini’s core values has always been to seek regulatory oversight and licensing whenever possible. And we firmly believe in asking for permission rather than for forgiveness — we do not operate in an area until we have received the necessary licenses or regulatory approvals to do so. Our trust license from the State of New York allowed us to work closely with both New York and Washington state regulators to obtain approval to operate. It was truly exciting and remarkable to see this collaboration between two of the most well respected state regulators, all in the name of innovation.\n\nEven before obtaining approval to operate within Washington, we met the standards set forth by the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions. These protections benefit _all_ Gemini customers, regardless of where you live.\n\nWe hope you agree that this is a momentous achievement not only for Gemini, but also for the digital asset ecosystem as a whole.\n\nLastly, if you are wondering if we are open in your area, please check out our [areas of operation page](https://gemini.com/areas-of-operation/).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n\n\n### You Can Now Trade Bitcoin and Ether in Canada!\n\n__June 6, 2016__\n\nWe are thrilled to announce the expansion of Gemini services to the Great White North!

It allows instant and trustless peer-to-peer transacting while limiting the amount of data needed on-chain.\n\nIn this post, I break down exactly how it works, as well as a newly proposed update protocol within it called **_eltoo_** (named after _L2_).\n\n### Unidirectional Channels\n\nSay you want to start such a channel with Netflix. First, you create a **funding transaction**, which is you locking up a certain amount of your money that you are willing to pay to Netflix (but have not yet paid them).\n\nSay you fund this transaction with 10 Bitcoin and publish it on the Bitcoin blockchain. After being mined, this funding transaction can be spent by a 2-of-2 multisig consisting of your’s and Netflix’s keys.\n\nAs Netflix starts streaming you bytes of video, you start streaming them money — say .000001 Bitcoin per minute of video — via partially signed transactions that spend this funding transaction.\n\nUsing the funding transaction as input, you create two new outputs: one sending .000001 to Netflix, and the other 9.999999 to you. You sign this transaction and share it with Netflix off-chain (that is, without attempting to publish it to the Bitcoin blockchain). This transaction is considered “partially signed” because it only contains one of the two signatures necessary to spend.\n\nWhen Netflix receives this partially-signed transaction, they are in control. Netflix can choose to claim that .000001 Bitcoin immediately, and in the process send the remaining 9.999999 Bitcoin back to you, by adding their signature to the partially signed transaction and publishing it. This is considered _closing the channel_ or a _settlement_.\n\nInstead, Netflix will continue streaming you video so long as you keep providing larger partially signed transactions every minute.   \nAfter another minute, you send Netflix another partially signed transaction using the same funding transaction as the input. This new partially signed transaction would send .000002 Bitcoin to Netflix (to reflect the two minutes of watch time), and 9.999998 Bitcoin to you. You keep doing this every minute.\n\nWith unidirectional payment channels, there’s no possibility of cheating. If you stop sending Netflix partially signed transactions every minute for higher amounts each time, Netflix will stop streaming you video. They will sign the most recent partially signed transaction you sent them (which entitles them to the most Bitcoin), publish it, and thus close the channel.\n\nFurthermore, there’s no risk of anyone publishing an “outdated” transaction. Netflix is the only one capable of spending any of the partially signed transactions (since Netflix has your signatures, but you don’t have any of theirs), and every newer partially signed transaction you send Netflix is strictly better for them than any older one. Netflix can only cheat _itself_ by publishing an earlier transaction.\n\nWhen money flows in both directions, this gets trickier. Both parties can publish transactions, so incentives exist to publish an outdated transaction.\n\n### The Problem with Bidirectional Channels\n\nBy not publishing this transaction, Bob keeps their channel open. He later agrees to pay Alice .3 BTC for a painting.\n\nIf Bob sends Alice a partially signed transaction that uses the funding transaction as its input, they will each be in possession of a different, yet valid, spend of the same funding transaction. Transactions have no expiration date in Bitcoin, so their transactions will be valid forever.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if they keep sending partially signed transactions back and forth for other goods and services. Either of them can act maliciously by publishing any earlier transaction that entitled them to more Bitcoin, thereby closing the channel, and making all other signed transactions invalid.\n\nBidirectional channels need a way to _invalidate outdated transactions_ so that only the _most_ _recent_ _signed transaction_ can be used to close the channel. That’s where _eltoo_ comes in.\n\n### eltoo\n\nThough LN-Penalty works today, it has problems. Besides its complexity, edge cases exist where it risks accidentally penalizing an honest user. [_eltoo_](https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf)  is not yet usable because it relies on a proposed signature scheme [**_SIGHASH\\_NOINPUT_**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0118.mediawiki)  which has yet to be adopted, but because it is not penalty-based, there’s no risk of losing your funds.\n\nIn eltoo, the two parties create the funding transaction denoted by **Setup** in the diagram below. The funding transaction could contain Bitcoin from both parties, because we anticipate money flowing in both directions.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*USwvkUzr2-EHHkImnYz6gw.png)\n\nEach circle represents a transaction output. Diagram from the eltoo whitepaper.\n\nBefore signing the funding transaction, Alice and Bob first sign a _settlement transaction_ (**Ts,0** in the above diagram) which refunds the Bitcoin in the funding transaction to each appropriate party. In eltoo, the term “settlement transaction” describes any transaction that distributes funds back to the participants, rather than to a multisig output that they both control.\n\nAfter they sign the first settlement transaction, the parties can safely sign the funding transaction. The locking script for the funding transaction looks as follows:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uwZjVnlT4wPXjWHP11YXyw.png)\n\nLocking script for the funding transaction, and any other update transaction. Image from the eltoo whitepaper.\n\nThere are two ways to spend the funding transaction: one in the _IF_ branch, and one in the _ELSE_ branch. These two branches rely on two separate sets of keys: the _IF_ branch requires _settlement keys_, and the _ELSE_ branch requires _update keys_. The two parties, Alice and Bob, each control one key from both sets of keys.\n\nYou’ll notice that the settlement branch of this locking script contains **10 OP\\_CSV** (short for **_OP\\_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY_**) as its first instruction. Any transaction attempting to spend this funding transaction by unlocking the _IF_ branch can only do so if 10 blocks have passed from when the funding transaction entered the blockchain. If Alice and Bob exchanged signatures for the settlement transaction, then published the funding transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain, then published that settlement transaction, it would take 10 blocks before their settlement transaction could be mined to give them control of their respective funds.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"3huNZypGqxAsPdAuNAncqR","blogIntroduction":"Last August, Gemini announced its participation in the Virtual Commodities Association (VCA).

This designation will allow the VCA to operate similarly to SROs in other industries, most notably the traditional financial industry, where the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and National Futures Association (NFA) have self-regulatory authority over financial institutions.\n\nOne of the first steps in this process is to create a framework which will eventually form sensible regulation for virtual commodity marketplaces. To do so, the VCA has launched six key committees that will help set standards, sound practices, and oversight.\n\nThe VCA will also be governed by a [Board of Directors](https://virtualcommodities.org/#Governance). I have been appointed President of the Board and Hailey Lennon, Esq., Head of Legal and Regulatory Affairs at bitFlyer USA, Inc. has been appointed Secretary of the Board. Special Advisors, which will oversee all committees, are Ellen Zimiles and Alma Angotti (Navigant Consulting, Inc.) and Dana Syracuse (Perkins Coie, LLP).\n\nSeveral regulatory agencies have called upon the cryptocurrency industry to provide better oversight and surveillance of cryptocurrency markets. Through these committees, which will be led by financial and crypto industry subject matter experts, the VCA will adopt best practices and standards commonplace in traditional financial markets for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians.\n\nThe six committees and leads include:\n\n**BSA/AML** — led by Michael Carter (Alvarez \u0026 Marsal) to apply Bank Secrecy Act BSA/Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) controls, including blockchain analytics, transaction monitoring and investigations.\n\n**Custody and Security** — co-led by Adam Cohen (Redgrave LLP) and Nicole Becher with a focus on implementing and maintaining current best practices for cryptocurrency custody, which is based heavily on cryptographic principles.\n\n**Enforcement** — led by Philip Moustakis (Seward \u0026 Kissel, LLP) to enforce the regulatory framework established by the VCA, keeping the VCA members accountable. This includes maintaining a system of marketplace conduct rules, implementing policies and procedures, and responding to and addressing customer concerns and complaints.\n\n**Insurance** — co-led by Matthew Gaul (Mayer Brown, LLP) and Alexander Sand (Eversheds Sutherland US, LLP) to establish minimum, appropriate insurances and coverages for cryptocurrency exchanges and custodians.\n\n**Market Integrity** — led by Michael Roe (Exiger), to facilitate cross-market information sharing, consolidated audit trails and cross-market surveillance to detect and deter manipulative and fraudulent activity.\n\n**Tax **— leader announcement forthcoming, will focus on establishing tax framework and interpreting and establishing tax code law as it relates to cryptocurrency trading.\n\nWe still have a long way to go but I am happy with where we are headed. The VCA is grateful to the individuals and companies willing to commit their time towards these committees and advance the goals of the VCA in fostering consumer protection and market integrity for the virtual currency industry.\n\nI’m personally grateful to work for a company that takes matters like security, regulation, and consumer protections so seriously.

The energy and passion of the Bitcoin community was something we had never felt before — it was electric. But it was also a complete Wild West and not even close to being ready for prime time. Those early days — equal parts exciting and scary — are exactly why we founded Gemini; **_to build trust_** in this nascent technology.\n\nEven though our industry is still young and there is much work ahead, the days of Mt. Gox feel like ancient history. Every day, we march forward, leaving our former self behind; almost unrecognizable. And there’s no better way to measure how far our industry has come than by taking a good look at its past.\n\nIn a new book called [_Bitcoin Billionaires_](https://amzn.to/2WufX6V), author Ben Mezrich deftly captures the colorful, frontier days of the cryptocurrency revolution. Ben is no stranger to writing about technology revolutions. His book _Accidental Billionaires_, which was later made into the movie _The Social Network_, chronicled the early days of social-networking, when many still dismissed it as just a fad. In some sense, Ben’s choice of our industry as his subject matter is both a rite of passage and another indication that we are onto something.\n\nBen first reached out to us in the winter of 2017 to catch up and learn more about what we had been working on since he last wrote about us in 2009. I don’t think either of us ever imagined that our paths would cross again in the same way. But early on in our conversation, two things became clear; Ben immediately understood the promise of cryptocurrency and was serious about telling its story to the world. This ultimately made us and many others comfortable with sharing our experiences with him.\n\nWhether you are a longtime HODLer or have just arrived, we think you will enjoy this book and find it worthwhile — it’s easier to understand where we’re headed as an industry if you have a good sense of where we started. Nothing captures this better than _Bitcoin Billionaires._ We encourage you to pick up a copy and add it to your summer reading list — happy reading!\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler + Cameron","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"5TNBDdxFh3Y4IigY4vMJH7","blogIntroduction":"Protecting your crypto is a cornerstone of our mission to build the future of money.

We have operated from day one with a _security-first_ mentality and have focused on providing our customers with layered security features to help them protect their Gemini accounts. Simply put, **_trust is our product_**.\n\nToday, we’re excited to raise the bar even higher by introducing support for **hardware** **security keys** via [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) (“Web Authentication”). You can now use USB security keys (e.g., Yubikeys, Feitian keys, Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets, etc.), MacOS TouchID, and even Windows Hello as your two-factor authentication (2FA) method when signing in to your Gemini account. **_Gemini is the world’s first crypto exchange and custodian to support the WebAuthn security protocol._**\n\nUsing hardware security keys via WebAuthn to secure your Gemini account provides hardware-backed, cryptographic proof that it is you (and not someone else) signing in to your Gemini account — this prevents someone else from signing into your Gemini account even if they have your password. Using hardware security keys via WebAuthn also ensures that you only submit your two-factor credentials to the actual Gemini website and not a malicious website pretending to be the Gemini website.\n\n**Advanced Security Protection**\n\n_Recently, we published a blog post outlining_ [_best practices_](https://medium.com/gemini/best-practices-for-securing-your-gemini-account-52ae44753ef4) _for securing your Gemini account. We encourage you to read it if you have not already done so._\n\nWe’ve added many layers of security throughout the years to help you keep your digital assets safe. Since our launch in 2015, we have _always_ required 2FA for all account sign ins; this has never been an opt-in security feature. We use the [Authy app](https://authy.com/features/) for 2FA, which either generates a secure 7-digit code on your mobile device or sends a code via SMS (Note: [We encourage you use the Authy app for 2FA rather than SMS](https://medium.com/gemini/better-two-factor-authentication-2fa-a40e13c963f2)). This code is required when signing in to your Gemini account and when performing high-risk actions, like withdrawing your crypto.\n\nBut even with 2FA enabled via Authy, an attacker can stand up a website that looks just like Gemini, and ask for your username, password, and 2FA codes. Once divulged, your credentials can be used to access your Gemini account and ultimately withdraw your crypto. To mitigate this risk, we require additional email verification when you sign in from a new device. We also added support for [Authy Push](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-authy-push-c02a6a9e9698) last year, which means that customers who have the Authy app installed will automatically receive a push notification that contains transaction details and requires confirmation every time they make a crypto withdrawal attempt. Furthermore, Authy Push will surface inconsistencies in a withdrawal in the event your computer is infected with malware.\n\nTwo weeks ago, we released a self-service tool called [Withdrawal Address Whitelisting](https://medium.com/gemini/best-practices-for-securing-your-gemini-account-52ae44753ef4). When enabled, your crypto may only be withdrawn from your Gemini account to specific crypto addresses (submitted and approved by you).\n\n**Securing your Gemini Account with WebAuthn**\n\nYou can register hardware security keys by going to your account [security settings](https://exchange.gemini.com/settings/security) page (you must be logged in). If you have more than one hardware security key, you may register multiple keys for added redundancy. When you register multiple hardware security keys, we’ll give you the option to exclusively use your hardware security keys for signing in to your Gemini account, which will disable 2FA codes sent via Authy or SMS. Withdrawals will continue to require Authy Push notification (or an SMS code) to confirm.\n\nAuthy Push, Whitelisting, and today’s announcement of WebAuthn, give you the advanced tools you need to secure your Gemini account. We will continue to strive to be the most secure place for you to buy, sell, and store your crypto today and tomorrow.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"5Eht6Bpw9hNycriD48FVL3","blogIntroduction":"We are excited to announce another major step forward as we build the future of money: our partnership with Flexa, a global cryptocurrency p...","datePublished":"May 13, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"flexa-and-gemini-partner-to-make-it-easy-to-use-cryptocurrency","title":"Flexa and Gemini Partner to Make it Easy to Use Cryptocurrency","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Launching today, consumers can now easily spend their [Gemini dollars](https://gemini.com/dollar/) (GUSD), bitcoin, ether, and bitcoin cash using the SPEDN mobile wallet app. (SPEDN is available in the iOS Apple store).\n\nIn addition, all cryptocurrency you deposit on the SPEDN mobile app is custodied with Gemini, providing security for those using this new payment technology.\n\nThe Flexa cryptocurrency payments network has the potential to transform the payments industry, providing everyday use cases for spending your crypto, which hasn’t been a practical reality until now. The majority of cryptocurrency activity to date has been comprised of the “buy,” “sell,” and “store” use case — investors looking to purchase a piece of the networks and protocols of the future. This has helped bootstrap crypto networks and create liquidity and price discovery (i.e., helping foster efficient and healthy markets), however, tangible use cases are the next step in the story of crypto’s promise.\n\nFlexa’s payment solution provides users the ability to engage in the “spend” use case and benefit from the freedom, privacy, and security provided by cryptocurrency. Additionally, the Gemini dollar allows you to spend your dollars on the blockchain without worrying about price volatility.\n\nMore broadly speaking, this is exciting for cryptocurrency users and our community as a whole. At Gemini, we have been trying to build a bridge from the island of crypto to the mainland of finance for the past five years. Flexa’s mission is to link the island of crypto to the mainland of retail merchants. Together, by providing Flexa with trusted custody and infrastructure, we hope to profoundly improve the payment experience; and merchants who are currently subject to overly complex, expensive legacy systems of credit and debit cards stand to benefit _significantly_.\n\nIn fact, major retailers pay billions of dollars each year in processing costs (costs that are often borne at least in part by the consumer). With Flexa, merchants (i) get significantly less expensive and fraud-resistant transactions, (ii) can use the same payment hardware they currently use, and (iii) receive payment in fiat currency, not crypto. We believe that not only will this result in cost-savings to the merchant, but to the consumer in the long-term as well.\n\nWe are excited to work with Flexa to connect the crypto payment rails to the offline world. Our respective firms share the same mission and values — working to build the future of money.

Our [security-first](https://medium.com/gemini/cold-storage-keys-crypto-how-gemini-keeps-assets-safe-a732addcd13b) mentality is baked into all of our products, serving as a true differentiator in the cryptocurrency industry. Our industry-leading [SOC 2](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian-d923790506d0) Type 1 security compliance demonstrates our commitment to security and building trust in cryptocurrency as an asset class — **_trust is our product_**.\n\nEmpowering Gemini customers is also important. We recently released a self-service tool — **Withdrawal Address Whitelisting** — to provide our customers with an additional layer of protection on their Gemini accounts. Whitelisting allows our customers to (i) ban all withdrawal activity, or (ii) restrict withdrawals from their Gemini account to specific, approved addresses.\n\nAs we continue to upgrade this whitelisting feature and other account-level security options, below are additional security recommendations — including details on whitelisting, passwords, and best practices for managing your Gemini account and digital assets more broadly.\n\n**PASSWORDS \u0026 ACCOUNT ACCESS**\n\nThe strongest passwords are impossible to guess. You should always use strong passwords to secure your desktop and laptop devices _as well as_ your Gemini account. Instead of writing down strong passwords — which you should never do — we recommend using a password manager.\n\nUtilize a password manager’s built-in features to create unique, complex, and bespoke passwords for each site you require credentials for. It is far easier for the human mind to remember one complex password (i.e., for the password manager itself) which will then allow you to copy-and-paste any stored passwords from the manager to any websites you use, including Gemini.\n\nAlways remember that Gemini will never contact you asking for your passwords, PIN numbers, or password-manager information. If you ever receive an email requesting such information, please forward it to us at [fraud@gemini.com](mailto:fraud@gemini.com).\n\nIf you use the Gemini mobile app, we recommend securing it with biometric authentication via TouchID or FaceID for every login. A PIN you can easily remember, and never write down, is recommended for backup.\n\n**TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION (2FA)**\n\nDuring account setup, we require users to go through the two-factor authentication process. This verifies your possession of _two of the three recognized factors_ for authentication: (1) Something you have (like a mobile device or hardware token), (2) something you know (like a password or PIN), and (3) something you are (which is identified by your fingerprint, face, or government-issued ID).\n\nGemini’s method for 2FA authentication is Authy, a commercial application which you can download to your mobile device or desktop computer [here](https://authy.com/download/). SMS verification is available; however Authy is more secure. For the highest level of security, we also recommend [disabling](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005755446-How-do-I-download-Authy-) the multi-device option in your Authy app settings. This will protect you from other devices being added with the ability to authenticate your logins.\n\nIn the event you have a new phone or phone number, you may temporarily lose access to Authy 2FA. You can resolve any 2FA lockout using the instructions [here](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005755506-What-do-I-do-if-I-can-no-longer-access-my-account-with-2FA-).\n\n**ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT**\n\nAs you continue your Gemini account setup, you’ll link bank accounts to use as U.S. dollar funding sources for trading. The accounts you connect should be secured by strong passwords, ideally stored in a password manager.\n\nAlways practice situational awareness with your Gemini account: Never give out personal identifying information through untrusted sources, never allow remote access into your computer, and remember that Gemini’s primary support channel is email — not phone. (Our support team only calls customers in special cases, after coordinating a time and date via email.) When accessing the Gemini website, only use the URLs [https://gemini.com](https://gemini.com) or [https://exchange.gemini.com/signin](https://exchange.gemini.com/signin).\n\nOnce you deposit funds and start trading, review the Transaction History in your account settings regularly. If you ever suspect suspicious activity, please report it to us immediately at [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com) or [fraud@gemini.com](mailto:fraud@gemini.com).\n\n**WITHDRAWAL BANS \u0026 WHITELISTING**\n\nIn order to withdraw from your account, you will need to complete our full onboarding process (including uploading a government ID). Once that’s complete, U.S. dollar funds can be withdrawn to any connected bank account and cryptocurrencies can be sent to any withdrawal address associated with the currency type (BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, ZEC, or GUSD).\n\nFor added security, you can use withdrawal address whitelisting to (i) ban cryptocurrency withdrawals, or (ii) restrict them to specific, approved addresses only. This ensures that in the unlikely event of an account takeover, your cryptocurrencies on Gemini **cannot** be sent to an unknown address.\n\nOnce you enable whitelisting in your account settings, _you will not be able to withdraw_ until there are active addresses on your whitelist. You can leave your whitelist empty to maintain a ban on all withdrawals.\n\nYou can add addresses, delete addresses, or edit address labels any time through your account settings on the Gemini website (whitelist information is read-only on the Gemini mobile app). For individual accounts, every address is subject to a seven-day holding period before it is activated for withdrawals. Whitelisting offline (or “cold”) addresses only is recommended.\n\nOn accounts with multiple users, address requests can only be made by account administrators or managers. Requests are subject to a dual-control process, whereby a fellow administrator or manager must approve each request (eliminating the need for a seven-day holding period).\n\nAs an added security protection, you must contact [Gemini Customer Support](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) directly to disable whitelisting.\n\n**TRUSTED PROTECTIONS**\n\nAll self-service measures regarding passwords, 2FA, account management, and whitelisting build on other protections inherent to Gemini’s security processes.\n\nTemporary withdrawal holds are one example: Changing the [email address](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005755526-How-do-I-change-my-email-address-) on your account or resetting a forgotten password results in a 24-hour hold on cryptocurrency withdrawals. In addition, we allow users to freeze their accounts in the event of an unauthorized login or other suspicious activity. Once reported, incidents are investigated by our expert support and security teams.\n\nAdditionally, Gemini has instituted a means to identify when new devices are connecting to an account for the first time. This activity instantly prevents withdrawals until subsequently verified by the account owner.\n\nAccount freezing and withdrawal bans (via whitelisting) offer the highest level of security because they restrict customers’ cryptocurrency holdings to Gemini, which we view as ultimately the safest option for customers. Our security approach is further bolstered by platform and marketplace protections that include U.S. dollar capital reserves, [digital asset insurance](https://medium.com/gemini/digital-assets-insurance-adbfb0c44e74), [market surveillance](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-marketplace-surveillance-technology-275f8ebb125) technology, and a SOC 2 Type 1 security review by [Deloitte](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian-d923790506d0).\n\n[Security](https://gemini.com/security/), Product, Licensing, and Compliance are the four pillars of Gemini, and our efforts are setting the standard for cybersecurity in the crypto industry. As we deliver further security features and enhancements over the course of 2019, we will continue to share best practices for investing safely and securely in the **_future of money_**.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"14jAnHOavQ5p5PdxtEwE89","blogIntroduction":"Gemini was built with the simple goal of making it safe and easy to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency: a first critical step in our missio...","datePublished":"Apr 30, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-partners-with-harbor-to-fund-investments-leveraging-gemini-dollars","title":"Gemini Partners with Harbor to Fund Investments Leveraging Gemini Dollars","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

This was the completion of a year-long effort to support new cryptocurrencies, improve customer experience, and adopt best practices for network usage. We wanted to share more about our overall wallet infrastructure project and the decisions made along the way.\n\nOur team custom-built the first Gemini wallet — a safe, secure wallet and signing infrastructure — around market conditions in 2014. As the market evolved so did our needs: we needed software capable of supporting a fee market, multiple networks, and multiple cryptocurrencies.\n\nWe sought out new tools and partnered with [Chris Stewart](https://twitter.com/Chris_Stewart_5), the developer of bitcoin-s, to add support for each of our target cryptocurrencies. In 2018, we launched support for Zcash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash using a more robust, modernized crypto wallet infrastructure.\n\nAfter debuting these new cryptocurrencies on Gemini, we turned our focus to migrating Bitcoin.\n\nAs part of the upgrades this year, we introduced support for Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses and transaction batching. As our customers may have noticed this means that SegWit addresses — which begin with _bc1_ — can now be used for Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. Both of these improvements required end-to-end integration through our online and offline signing systems (along with many other efforts).\n\nOur decisions about SegWit and batching were not made lightly. Building trust in cryptocurrencies as an asset class — and in Gemini as a platform — motivates every product choice we make. This is especially true of changes that affect our end customer’s experience, as these wallet updates do.\n\n**Understanding SegWit**\n\nThe SegWit protocol update, which activated in late 2017, changed the way information is stored and processed on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSegWit allows digital signature information to be stored separately (or _segregated_) from its transaction data. Without signatures, Bitcoin transactions weigh around 30–40 percent less, thus taking up less “block space” on the network and reducing the transaction fee. As block space is limited, any decrease in transaction size allows for more transactions per block and greater overall throughput in the network.\n\nOur choice to use native SegWit addresses was based on block space savings as well as safety concerns. Specifically, native SegWit addresses work _only_ on the Bitcoin blockchain — they do not work for other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, however, cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin can be sent to a legacy (non-native SegWit) address, which can cause loss of funds. Some other Bitcoin exchanges and custodians have offered partial SegWit support (withdrawals and legacy P2SH-style addresses) since early 2018, but **_Gemini is the first major exchange to launch full support of SegWit_**, complete with native SegWit deposit addresses. We think it’s the right time to make this change, though there will still be some growing pains. Notably, while some block explorers are capable of tracking native SegWit addresses, the support varies widely from one solution to another.\n\nThese considerations, among many others, factored into Gemini’s decisions about when and how to launch SegWit support.\n\n**Realizing the Benefits**\n\nOur team views SegWit as a positive step forward for crypto and the broader **_future of money_**. As SegWit’s use, support, and adoption grows, it will help reduce fees, wait times, and network congestion. Critically, SegWit transactions lay the groundwork for more advanced technologies; of which the Lightning network is the most well known.\n\nWe believe SegWit will become the standard, and in doing so, will create extensive benefits for all participants on the Bitcoin network.\n\nGiven the level of community adoption — and ecosystem support — we now recommend that all Gemini customers move to using SegWit addresses. After extensive testing and development, we know that launching SegWit support is the right decision for our customers at the right time. Start using SegWit addresses (or [click here](https://exchange.gemini.com/deposit/btc) to make one) to support our mission and our commitment to building a better Bitcoin experience and the **_future of money_**.\n\nOnwards and Upwards,\n\nBrian KimJohnson, Software Engineer","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"55H3HUoyKmAkt1MxV6S1cF","blogIntroduction":"Today marks the one-year anniversary of Gemini Block Trading™, a fully electronic block trading facility.

Meeting the speed and connectivity expectations of our customers is essential to the success of both our business and the broader cryptocurrency revolution. A best-in-class infrastructure, including one that is safe, secure, and high performing helps Gemini meet the standards established by traditional financial markets.\n\nMicroseconds matter to our customers, and Gemini is continually breaking down speed barriers without compromising stability and reliability. Recent enhancements equip us with a fast, trusted, and resilient framework for meeting the exacting demands of the international financial markets.\n\n**Adapting for Speed**\n\nLike most startups, Gemini originated in an AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure. This approach allowed for fast development and iteration without the overhead of running a proprietary data center.\n\nOur first iteration in AWS was focused on proving out the components needed for us to operate appropriately as both an exchange and custodian. Excellence during this first generation focused on operational stability and security to build trust with our customers, who were a mix of individual and institutional investors.\n\nAs Gemini grew, we focused on providing our institutional customers the same high-grade platform that fits within the toolset that professional traders are accustomed to. We did not believe institutional investors should have to trade cryptocurrencies differently than they trade equities, options, or commodities.\n\nReaching that kind of performance required us to shift our infrastructure to a lower latency model with higher-power systems capable of executing trades in microseconds.\n\nTo make that possible, we opted to locate our infrastructure within the financial services data center hub located in Equinix’s NY5 facility in Secaucus, New Jersey in the summer of 2017. This makes us the **_world’s first and only_** crypto exchange powered from NY5 — arming us with new reach, scale, and a trusted framework for doing business with global institutions.\n\n**Direct Connectivity**\n\nOur infrastructure is consistent with the connectivity mechanisms and protocols already in use by institutional traders. We built our infrastructure to be capable of accepting direct physical connections into our networks for trading leveraging the Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol and high-speed matching engines.\n\nOffering direct physical connections means that customers also located in the Equinix NY5 campus can request cross connects to our customer network edge with just a single hop to their market data, order entry, and drop copy sessions. We are also connecting to financial services extranets such as [BT Radianz](https://www.globalservices.bt.com/en/aboutus/news-press/gemini-joins-the-bt-radianz-cloud-community) to more seamlessly integrate into connectivity that institutions likely already have.\n\nGemini also offers redundant connections to institutional customers and an option to connect to our disaster recovery (DR) site in Chicago. These options are standard on any regulated financial exchange, and Gemini is no different.\n\n**Scale for the Future**\n\n**Product**, **Security**, **Licensing**, and **Compliance** are the four pillars of Gemini. Our commitment to Product means that as we focus on building trust and rules for the crypto asset class, we will also need to build infrastructure that will scale to the future of money.\n\nSince our infrastructure changes last year, we have been measuring execution time in microseconds rather than milliseconds. In 2019, we hope to measure even faster speeds as we continue to enhance the trading experience for all of our customers.\n\nOnwards and Upwards,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"1gTGsdFzZdwHTrvQgNwUL9","blogIntroduction":"Recent events in the cryptocurrency industry have elevated an important conversation about how cryptocurrencies are custodied by individuals...","datePublished":"Feb 12, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"cold-storage-keys-crypto-how-gemini-keeps-assets-safe","title":"Cold Storage, Keys \u0026 Crypto: How Gemini Keeps Assets Safe","blogAuthors":[{"id":"4xSZEB8FKphQeCti3ZhnLE","authorName":"Eric Winer","authorPosition":"VP of Engineering","intro":"Eric Winer is VP of Engineering at Gemini, the first fully regulated U.S. bitcoin and ethereum exchange.

People have many choices when it comes to storing their crypto assets, from self-custody options like a hardware or software wallet, to regulated and unregulated exchanges. There are varying opinions around which approach is best, but each comes with its own tradeoffs and level of risk that a consumer should understand and be comfortable taking on.\n\nWe believe that for most investors, storing their cryptocurrency on a regulated and secured crypto exchange and qualified custodian, such as Gemini, is the right approach for the many reasons we will discuss below.\n\nTrust has been the foundation of Gemini’s business — our product — since we [launched](https://medium.com/gemini/and-were-live-3ff3b9edd5bd). As a regulated cryptocurrency exchange and qualified custodian, we’ve invested years of effort and millions of dollars in technical and control measures to help prevent undue losses and nefarious activity. As observers of our recent [ad campaign](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/winklevoss-twins-gemini-ad-campaign-hopes-to-ignite-the-peoples-movement-2019-01-09) know, we have a [strong point of view](https://medium.com/gemini/geminis-principles-for-the-crypto-revolution-1e42a8bea3af) about the importance of regulatory oversight, compliance, and security in the crypto space. We’ve backed up that point of view by demonstrating our protections by [completing](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian-d923790506d0) a SOC 2 Type 1 review conducted by Deloitte \u0026 Touche LLP, a Big Four auditor.\n\nAs you embark on the crypto journey, it’s important to determine what approach is right for you. Do you prefer storing your dollars under your mattress instead of a bank? If so, then the “digital mattress” equivalent of a hardware or software wallet is right for you. If you prefer to keep your assets in a regulated financial institution, then a regulated financial institution is the best option to store your cryptocurrency. This will require you to identify which [organizations to trust](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dantedisparte/2019/01/29/gemini-the-winklevoss-twins-break-new-ground-on-digital-trust/#5062ebf826b6), and that starts by understanding the protections and protocols necessary to safely store, secure, or facilitate access to your holdings.\n\nWhen assessing an organization’s custody services, there are several measures you should consider. For instance, what jurisdiction does the organization operate in? What type of licensing does the company have? Is there regulatory oversight? What is the background of the executive team? What are the company’s core values? Was the company built with a security-first mentality?\n\nGemini is a safe place to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrency — not because we say it is — but because of the measures we have put place to protect your crypto and the independent third parties that verify them. They are as follows:\n\n[**Redundancy with keys**](https://gemini.com/security/) **(and the facilities and devices that store keys).**\n\n*   All of our private keys, which are used to sign cryptocurrency transactions, are custodied offsite in the secure, guarded, geographically distributed facilities of our Cold Storage system. These keys exist on hardware security modules (HSMs) that meet or exceed [FIPS 140–2 Level 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2#Level_3) U.S. government computer security standards.\n*   Multisignature technology (or “Multisig”) provides added security from attacks and increased fault tolerance. We have contingencies in place in the event of a catastrophe or if all of our facilities and equipment in an entire region were to become inaccessible or destroyed.\n\n[**Digital asset insurance**](https://medium.com/gemini/digital-assets-insurance-adbfb0c44e74) **and capital reserves.**\n\n*   A small portion of crypto are held in Gemini’s online “Hot Wallet” environment, with key management via dedicated FIPS 140–2 Level 2 HSMs provided through the AWS Cloud. We [maintain insurance](https://gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#digital-asset-insurance/) (from a combination of underwriters) in an aggregate amount that is _greater than the value of our customer’s crypto assets held in our Hot Wallet_.\n*   We also maintain capital reserves, which are required of us as a New York trust company and fiduciary under the New York Banking Law. All customer U.S. dollar fiat funds held in omnibus accounts are held at FDIC-insured banks in the United States, and these funds are segregated and legally distinct from our business and operating accounts. Capital reserve requirements help ensure that Gemini has sufficient capital to continue operations and support our customers.\n\n**Extensive internal controls.**\n\n*   Multiple signatories are required to transfer funds out of Cold Storage. Our CEO (Tyler Winklevoss) and President (Cameron Winklevoss) are unable to individually or jointly transfer customer funds into or out of our Hot Wallet or Cold Storage system.\n\nCustomers seeking additional protections have even more options. For large crypto holders, we offer [custody services](https://gemini.com/custody/) with segregated addresses. And for any  Gemini account, [whitelisting](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001411543-How-do-I-enable-withdrawal-address-whitelisting-) can be enabled to prevent assets from being sent to unknown addresses.\n\nWe designed all of these measures from our firm belief that using a regulated, trusted, qualified custodian is the best option for storing cryptocurrency holdings of any size. Because we serve both individuals and institutions, we can offer bank-level protections to hobbyist traders and professional users alike. As discussed above, using a hardware wallet, software wallet, or unregulated exchange is the digital equivalent of keeping cash under your mattress: It’s an option — and perhaps a useful one for small amounts (just like having $20 in your back pocket is) — but it gets riskier as your holdings grow.\n\nGemini’s team recognizes that cryptocurrencies emerged from a combination of technological innovation and distrust of traditional, centralized institutions. But regulated, licensed financial institutions still have an important place in the world of cryptocurrencies, alongside new decentralized alternatives.\n\nTrue interoperability between the worlds of fiat currencies and cryptocurrency is crucial to keeping customers safe. **_As your bridge to the future of money_**, Gemini is advancing a future of crypto without chaos — one without catastrophic, unnecessary losses that harm consumers and stunt industry progress. We continually revisit the protections and protocols we use to store, secure, and facilitate access to your crypto holdings — and we hope all of our peers in the crypto space will do the same.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nEric Winer, VP of Engineering","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"1Fzn86eoGkc7b5VIRfOEw7","blogIntroduction":"In 2018, Gemini engaged with Big Four auditor Deloitte \u0026 Touche LLP (Deloitte) to execute a SOC 2® — SOC for Service Organizations Type 1 ex...","datePublished":"Jan 29, 2019","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"gemini-completes-soc-2-review-a-worlds-first-for-a-cryptocurrency-exchange-and-custodian","title":"Gemini Completes SOC 2 Review — A World’s First For a Cryptocurrency Exchange and Custodian","blogAuthors":[{"id":"01oyQ76hc4uXLpugPXZLl","authorName":"Yusuf Hussain","authorPosition":"Head of Risk","intro":"Yusuf Hussain is Gemini's Head of Risk and joined in January 2018.

This makes Gemini the **_world’s first cryptocurrency exchange and custodian to demonstrate this level of security compliance in protecting customer data and funds._**\n\nProviding you with a safe and secure platform to buy, sell, and store your cryptocurrency is paramount to our mission to **_build the future of money_**. In the traditional financial and technology industries, SOC 2 reviews have become an industry standard for demonstrating security compliance. Our SOC 2 review — coupled with our [digital asset insurance](https://medium.com/gemini/digital-assets-insurance-adbfb0c44e74) — is another step we’ve taken towards raising the bar for consumer protection, safeguards, and industry best practices.\n\nGemini’s exchange and custody platform was built with a “security-first” mentality from the start. Continuing that approach, Deloitte performed an independent evaluation of the design and implementation of Gemini’s security controls. These controls have been independently inspected to meet the trust services criteria set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). This included a review of Gemini’s exchange application, infrastructure, and underlying customer database, as well as its institutional-grade cryptocurrency storage system that custodies the private keys of Gemini’s online and offline wallets.\n\nWe feel strongly that this standard of compliance is what all retail and institutional consumers should expect of their cryptocurrency exchange and custodian. We know what’s at stake when you trade and store crypto. That is why, in addition to our SOC 2 Type 1 review, we are also committed to obtaining our SOC 2 Type 2 review in 2019. This additional level of assurance will further validate the effectiveness of our internal controls.\n\nGoing forward, we will perform a SOC 2 examination on an annual basis in order to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to safeguarding your data and cryptocurrency.\n\nFor questions, please reach out to [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nYusuf Hussain, Head of Risk","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4wypJ4l8ZI8Ny5jx0WCk9N","blogIntroduction":"Today, we ran a full-page ad in the New York Times outlining what we think the cryptocurrency revolution needs to succeed.

We firmly believe this revolution will re-architect trade, the financial system, the Internet, and money as we know it.\n\nBut it won’t be easy, and there is no guarantee.\n\nThe crypto revolution has the potential to solve meaningful, real-world problems that no other technology can — but only a thoughtful, rule-based approach will get us there. Revolutions that build sets of rules to ensure a better future, are the ones that last.\n\nAs a result, we are sharing the following set of guiding principles that we believe will help crypto fulfill its ultimate promise. As we build a real, sustainable bridge between the ‘old world’ of money and the future of money, we strive to always:\n\n**1\\. Build the Rules**.\n\n_To work with regulators to establish thoughtful regulation that promotes positive and fair outcomes for all._\n\nIn 2014, we [testified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZW7R7FPIJY) at the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Virtual Currency Hearings. These hearings set the stage for a thoughtful dialogue between the NYDFS and the crypto community, eventually leading to the New York [Virtual Currency Regulations](https://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsp200t.pdf). To date, NYDFS has licensed or chartered 12 virtual currency businesses. All of these businesses, including Gemini which is a New York trust company, operate within a regulatory framework that fosters consumer protection.\n\nIn addition, we have championed best practices that we believe make Gemini a safe place that fosters market integrity:\n\n*   **Marketplace Conduct Rules **— On September 21, 2017, we adopted [Marketplace Conduct Rules](https://gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#marketplace-conduct-rules). These rules were modeled off of the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC (CFE) [Rulebook](http://cfe.cboe.com/publish/cferulebook/cfe-rule-book.pdf).\n*   **Marketplace Surveillance** — On April 25, 2018, we [announced](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-marketplace-surveillance-technology-275f8ebb125) our partnership with Nasdaq to implement Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance technology to monitor the Gemini marketplace. As of August 10, 2018, SMARTS has been deployed on the Gemini marketplace.\n*   **Market Surveillance Team** — On April 25, 2018, we hired a Head of Market Surveillance. Since then, we have built a Market Surveillance Team that continues to grow.\n*   **Virtual Commodities Association** — On March 13, 2018, we published a [proposal](https://medium.com/gemini/a-proposal-for-a-self-regulatory-organization-for-the-u-s-virtual-currency-industry-79e4d7891cfc) for the Virtual Commodity Association, an industry-sponsored self-regulatory organization for virtual commodity exchanges. CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz issued a [public statement](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/quintenzstatement031318) in support. The [initial working group](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180820005066/en/Virtual-Commodity-Association-Working-Group-Formed-Planning) held its inaugural meeting in September 2018.\n\nThis is just the beginning as we plan to continue to engage and work with regulators across the country on both the state and federal level (Gemini currently has licenses or approvals in [49 states](https://gemini.com/areas-of-operation/)), as well as internationally, to help shape thoughtful regulation and oversight so that consumers are afforded the same protections in the crypto market as they are in more traditional markets.\n\n**2\\. Play by the Rules.**\n\n_To operate with necessary governmental or regulatory approvals. Ask for permission, not for forgiveness._\n\nAlthough we started building Gemini in 2014, we waited until we received our New York trust company license in October of 2015 to begin operating. Our decision — _to ask for permission, not forgiveness _— was a first in cryptocurrency. We chose this path because we believed that in order to **_build the future of money_**_,_ we had to first build trust in this new asset class.\n\nWe are a **_compliance-centric_** company — we have developed (and will continue to invest in) cutting edge tools for our Compliance Department to ensure that Gemini is not a place for bad actors.\n\n**3\\. Value Security Over Profit.**\n\n_To never cut corners. To set the standard and follow best practices in order to provide a platform that is free of hacking and fraud._\n\nFinancial crime affects both fiat and cryptocurrencies alike, but the crypto revolution will not succeed if our industry is plagued by nefarious activity. High-profile hacks that result in catastrophic losses must become a thing of the past, and we must shake the image of an industry characterized by poor security standards, internal controls, and policies and procedures.\n\nIn an effort to do so, we built our team with a **_security-first_** mentality from day one — a team that has built a state-of-the-art hot wallet and cold storage system and is deeply committed to employing [cybersecurity best practices](https://gemini.com/security/) to protect your funds and the integrity of our platform. Recently, we added a further layer of protection by securing [insurance](https://medium.com/gemini/digital-assets-insurance-adbfb0c44e74) coverage for the cryptocurrency that we hold on your behalf in our online hot wallet. We are, and will continue to be, committed to making Gemini a safe and secure platform to store your cryptocurrency.\n\n**4\\. Be Principled.**\n\n_To do the right thing — because it’s the right thing — even when it’s the hard thing. To put the interests of our customers ahead of our own and provide proper disclosures and transparency._\n\nThe four pillars of Gemini are **Product**, **Security**, **Licensing**, and **Compliance**. We refuse to compromise in any of these areas and will continue to invest in long-term solutions that align with our north star of building a company that provides enduring value to our customers — for more than a 100 years — _a_ **_Centurion_**. We will continue to do these things even when it’s the harder, less profitable, and slower path in the short-term. We’re in this for the long game; we’re trying to be the fastest tortoise in the race.\n\n**5\\. Pay it Forward.**\n\n_To bring cryptocurrency to the people and places that need it most._\n\nLike the invention of money itself, which solved the coincidence of wants dilemma and removed the shackles of barter; like the evolution of credit and debt, which helped transfer capital from idle savers to risk-taking entrepreneurs; like the invention of the joint-stock company, which spurred on investment by enabling atomistic ownership structures and limiting an investor’s liability to his or her stock ownership; and like the invention of the stock exchange, which allowed liquid markets for a company’s shares to emerge, the invention of cryptocurrencies have irrevocably expanded our concept of money and will forever change how we exchange, transfer, and store it.\n\nNot since the dawn of the Internet has technology had the potential for such profound impact. But in order to make such an impact, we must bring this technology to all reaches of the globe. We have started by building the [Gemini dollar](https://gemini.com/dollar/), which brings U.S. dollars onto the blockchain and to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. This is the first of many projects we hope to embark on that help foster, among other things, financial inclusion (e.g., banking the 1 billion+ unbanked citizens of the world), reduced friction and costs of cross-border payments (e.g., remittances), access to digital safe-haven assets (e.g., buying bitcoin through the [Gemini Mobile App](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-the-gemini-mobile-app-crypto-on-the-go-1448d2ae74fa)), and a more decentralized Internet that returns control of your data back to you.\n\n**Join the Gemini Mission**\n\nWe are only at the beginning of this journey. Yes, some of the hardest work remains ahead, but we’re up for the challenge and we know you are too. We welcome industry leaders, developers, builders, entrepreneurs, investors, and whoever else, to join us as we strive to build rules for this amazing revolution that will ensure not just the future of money, but a better future for _all_.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron + Tyler","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{"metaTitle":"Forging the future of finance","metaDescription":"Gemini is leading the crypto revolution.

We started building Gemini in 2014, but waited to operate until we received our New York trust company license in October of 2015. Our decision — _to ask for permission, not forgiveness_ — was a first in cryptocurrency. We chose this path because we believed that in order to **_build the future of money_** we had to build trust in this new asset class first.\n\nOur messaging from the beginning has remained the same and we are forever proud that the four pillars of Gemini: **Product**, **Security**, **Licensing**, and **Compliance**, stand as tall today as they did three years ago, when we first outlined them in our [launch blog post](https://medium.com/gemini/and-were-live-3ff3b9edd5bd). At the time, this was not a popular position, but we felt strongly that it was the right one.\n\nFast forwarding to 2018, we are grateful to have hit major milestones this year that have provided both thoughtful and safe products to our customers, while at the same time helping our industry grow as a whole. Below were some of our major highlights:\n\n*   [Marketplace Surveillance](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-marketplace-surveillance-technology-275f8ebb125) — We became the world’s first cryptocurrency marketplace to employ market surveillance technology to foster a rules-based marketplace.\n*   [Insurance](https://medium.com/gemini/digital-assets-insurance-adbfb0c44e74) — We secured insurance coverage for the cryptocurrency that we hold on your behalf in our online hot wallet. This bolsters Gemini’s position as a safe place to store your cryptocurrency.\n*   [Virtual Commodity Association](https://virtualcommodities.org/) — We helped [spearhead](https://medium.com/gemini/a-proposal-for-a-self-regulatory-organization-for-the-u-s-virtual-currency-industry-79e4d7891cfc) and [joined](https://medium.com/gemini/joining-the-virtual-commodity-association-8bdf3b2f803e) the Virtual Commodity Association, a group with the goal of establishing an industry-sponsored, self-regulatory organization (SRO) to oversee virtual commodity marketplaces.\n*   [Gemini Block Trading ](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-gemini-block-trading-ac80bdaa6320)— We launched a fully electronic block trading facility, enabling our customers to buy and sell large quantities of cryptocurrency outside of Gemini’s continuous order books.\n*   New Cryptos — We started the year with two cryptos (bitcoin and ether) and will end this year with five (for a total of 15 trading pairs). In May, we became the world’s first licensed [Zcash](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-is-now-the-worlds-first-licensed-zcash-exchange-dfa7da992816) exchange and custodian. In October, we launched support for [Litecoin](https://medium.com/gemini/litecoin-is-now-available-on-gemini-467d7d1079e6) trading and custody and in December, we launched support for [Bitcoin Cash](https://medium.com/gemini/bitcoin-cash-is-now-available-on-gemini-cc75299d892f) trading and custody.\n*   [Gemini dollar](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-launches-the-gemini-dollar-62787f963fb4) — We issued the world’s first regulated stablecoin that combines the creditworthiness and price stability of the U.S. dollar with blockchain technology and the oversight of U.S. regulators. You can read our white paper [here](https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf).\n*   [Gemini Mobile App](https://medium.com/gemini/introducing-the-gemini-mobile-app-crypto-on-the-go-1448d2ae74fa) — We extended Gemini’s trusted platform to mobile so you can trade crypto on the go. You can buy and sell cryptocurrency, set price alerts, set recurring buy orders, and buy The Cryptoverse™ (i.e., basket orders) and much more with the Gemini Mobile App. You can watch a demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOBzQa-ASI4).\n\nIt’s impossible to discuss 2018 (or 2017 for that matter) without acknowledging price. And while price and capital (i.e., money) entering (or leaving) a system are no doubt interesting abstractions of health, they don’t tell the whole story. For example, they won’t tell you about the most important type of capital — _human capital — _and how it is flooding into our space faster than ever. In the past year alone, 120+ new Astronauts have joined Gemini and our mission to build the **_future of money_**, including our [Chief Technology Officer](https://medium.com/gemini/welcoming-our-first-chief-technology-officer-1000319bd7be), [General Counsel](https://medium.com/gemini/welcoming-our-general-counsel-a1c856ce6dfe), [Managing Director of Operations](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181010005526/en/Jeanine-Hightower-Sellitto-Joins-Gemini-Managing-Director-Operations), Head of Risk, and Head of Market Surveillance. All of these individuals could have named their adventure, and they chose crypto. They decided they needed to be here. These folks have arrived for the long-term and are already building the next wave of crypto innovation.\n\nSimilar to the narrow focus on the price of cryptocurrencies, there is a tendency to do the same with respect to the valuations of startups. A coveted metric in startup land is the unicorn (a colloquialism for a company valued at more than a billion dollars). At Gemini, we have decided to focus on another metric; **_the Centurion_** — a company that lasts for more than 100 years. We value the long game and this is how we have chosen to measure ourselves. If we can continue to build trust and long-term, sustainable value for our customers, we are confident that everything else, including our own valuation, will follow.\n\nWhile it may not feel like it now, “crypto winter” is a wonderful thing. It’s a counterintuitive truth, but constraint is the mother of real, lasting innovation. It’s a forcing function for discipline, thoughtfulness, and authenticity. The future of cryptocurrency and the revolution to restructure trade, the financial system, the Internet, and money as we know it, will be more profoundly built and shaped during these times than any other.\n\nAs we close the chapter on 2018 and reflect on what the Gemini Spaceship and our valiant Astronauts have accomplished this year, we are more excited than ever. As long as we all keep our heads down, ignore the noise, and continue to build responsible products and a set of rules for a better future, the possibilities will be endless. Amazing awaits!\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTyler + Cameron","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2mTrQJT9MSsBEBzglubrru","blogIntroduction":"We began our mission to build the future of money by creating a licensed cryptocurrency exchange and custodian that allows our customers to ...","datePublished":"Dec 11, 2018","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"introducing-the-gemini-mobile-app-crypto-on-the-go","title":"Introducing the Gemini Mobile App — Crypto on the Go!","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2POTMnRzXX3ILQ393Ksob","authorName":"Tyler Winklevoss","authorPosition":"Co-Founder \u0026 CEO ","intro":"Tyler Winklevoss is co-founder and CEO of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Briefly, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset, such as fiat currency like U.S. dollars. Stablecoins are distinct from other cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, where the price is driven by market dynamics (i.e., supply and demand) and not from the asset which it corresponds to.\n\n_More information on understanding the counterparty risks of stablecoins can be found_ [_here_](https://gemini.com/static/dollar/Gemini-White-Paper-Gemini-Dollar_-Understanding-Counterparty-Risk.pdf)_, but please find a summarized version below._\n\nThe volatility of bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies, makes it difficult to use them as an everyday medium of exchange, whether you are a crypto-trader looking to arbitrage markets or a consumer looking to purchase a pizza. Despite the benefits, however, stablecoins have unique risks that are important for the market and their users to understand; namely counterparty risks.\n\nTo date, the market and the media have been primarily focused on one element of counterparty risk — whether there actually is one U.S. dollar sitting in the issuer’s bank account for each stablecoin in circulation (i.e.,  a  1:1 peg). Many stablecoin issuers have failed to demonstrate that they can honor full 1:1 redemptions. We’ve touched upon the 1:1 peg and the associated regulatory oversight necessary to address this risk in a prior [blog post](https://medium.com/gemini/gemini-launches-the-gemini-dollar-62787f963fb4), but there are other elements of counterparty risk that have been almost entirely ignored (or perhaps forgotten) by the market and the media — the counterparty risk of the bank holding the U.S. dollars and the counterparty risk of the stablecoin issuer.\n\nSo why does this matter? Imagine if you had a bank account, but you didn’t know _where_ it was located. Are your dollars held onshore, offshore, in a state bank, federal bank, etc.? Knowing your counterparty (i.e., the bank) is instrumental in assessing the risk profile of a stablecoin. Unfortunately, most stablecoin issuers have not provided transparency and visibility into the banks and financial institutions holding the corresponding U.S. dollars.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to understand if the stablecoin issuer has required licenses, both on a federal and state level, to issue a stablecoin. If not, it could be subject to regulatory enforcement and injunctive actions, indefinitely freezing your funds. Furthermore, if it is conducting unlicensed activity, it could lose its banking relationship and the bank account where your dollars are sitting.\n\nThese layers of counterparty risk are important to understand as you peel back the stablecoin onion. We believe the transparency of the [Gemini dollar](https://gemini.com/dollar/) allows users to properly underwrite and assess counterparty risk of both the bank and the issuer, as well as others:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*iVjoVcPQsG31XqIuBs-JrA.png)\n\nWe believe regulation, transparency (attestation reports [here](https://gemini.com/dollar/#reports), security assessment report [here](https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf), and other appropriate disclosures are crucial to mitigating counterparty risk and protecting stablecoin users. Unfortunately, many stablecoin issuers lack the appropriate licensing and fail to provide adequate transparency for users to appropriately assess risk. A digitized currency with a stable value on the blockchain is a huge step forward for the **_future of money_**, but it requires the appropriate counterparties and oversight to ensure its true stability.\n\nFor questions or other inquiries, please contact us at [gusd@gemini.com](mailto:gusd@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"wIA3y3dbRvtxQyw8i2A9D","blogIntroduction":"We are excited to announce support for Litecoin trading and custody on Gemini.

As a result, we will be offering the following new trading pairs and services:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*uth8GemzlhZfJxcRkHeRvQ.png)\n\nLitecoin is a fork of the original Bitcoin network and aims to grow the use of cryptocurrency for daily transactions, similar to the payment methods of the traditional banking system (e.g., cash, debit, and credit cards). Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin in an effort to further decentralize participation, and continues to be on the leading edge of efforts to increase adoption of cryptocurrency for payments.\n\nGemini is the world’s most regulated cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, held to the highest standards of banking compliance and fiduciary obligations, and overseen by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). The addition of Litecoin further solidifies Gemini’s standing as the go-to exchange for retail and institutional investors alike. Gemini continues to grow with a “security-first” approach and we have worked closely with the NYSDFS to gain approval for Litecoin trading and custody services. We are excited to provide our customers with a safe, secure, and compliant method to buy, sell, and store these digital assets. Customers leveraging Gemini’s API functionality can see our [updated symbol list here.](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#symbols-and-minimums)\n\nWe also had planned to announce support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) today as well. However, there has been much uncertainty lately within the Bitcoin Cash community about one or more possible hard forks arriving in mid-November. Some of those forks lack the replay protection feature that would be required for Gemini to safely support Bitcoin Cash. Because of this situation, we are delaying our launch of Bitcoin Cash deposits, withdrawals, and trading until late November, after the forks have passed and we can evaluate the health of the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. Until then, you may see some “coming soon” pages for Bitcoin Cash deposits, withdrawals, and trading on our website and APIs.\n\nWe remain certain that for cryptocurrency to realize its tremendous potential it is crucial to provide a safe and regulated environment for both innovation and consumer protection, and we are proud to work closely with both the market and regulators as we move towards the future of money.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nEric Winer, VP of Engineering","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"XdDKM1y0vDDci8v2gWkua","blogIntroduction":"After a series of due diligence roadshows with industry-leading insurers, we are pleased to announce that we have secured insurance coverage...","datePublished":"Oct 03, 2018","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"digital-assets-insurance","title":"Digital Assets Insurance","blogAuthors":[{"id":"01oyQ76hc4uXLpugPXZLl","authorName":"Yusuf Hussain","authorPosition":"Head of Risk","intro":"Yusuf Hussain is Gemini's Head of Risk and joined in January 2018.

This new coverage complements existing FDIC “pass through” deposit [insurance](https://gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#fdic-insurance) that your fiat funds (U.S. dollars) are eligible for.\n\nTo date, insurers have been hesitant to insure the crypto industry due to a large number of high-profile hacks that have resulted in catastrophic losses over the years, and the poor security standards, internal controls, and policies and procedures that have unfortunately characterized much of our industry. As a result, many crypto exchanges and custodians have been either (i) unable to obtain insurance or (ii) shied away from it due to the high cost of premiums required by the few insurers willing to insure the industry.\n\nHowever, we were able to successfully demonstrate to insurers that Gemini, a New York trust company, is indeed a safe and secure exchange and custodian where customers can buy, sell, and store digital assets in a regulated, secure, and compliant manner.\n\nYou can learn more about the steps we take to secure our hot wallet and your digital assets in our offline cold storage system [here](https://gemini.com/security/).

As a first step, this meant making it safe and easy to buy, sell, and store cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, ether, and Zcash. However, when fiat currency and cryptocurrency interact, the differences between the traditional banking system and cryptocurrencies become increasingly clear. While cryptocurrencies operate 24/7/365 (similar to email), fiat currencies only operate during specific “business hours” (like snail mail)  —  a fundamental mismatch. As a next step in our mission, we must improve the linkage between these worlds by giving fiat currency the same desirable technological qualities of cryptocurrencies.\n\nTo date, there has been no **_trusted and regulated_** digital representation of the U.S. dollar that moves in an open, decentralized manner like cryptocurrencies. Enter the **Gemini dollar**_ — _ a stable value coin (often called a “stablecoin”) that is (i) issued by Gemini, a New York trust company, (ii) strictly pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar, and (iii) built on the Ethereum network according to the ERC20 standard for tokens. The Gemini dollar (**ticker symbol:** **GUSD**) combines the creditworthiness and price stability of the U.S. dollar with blockchain technology and the oversight of U.S. regulators, namely, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). You can read more about the Gemini dollar  —  **_the world’s first regulated stablecoin_**  —  in our white paper [here](https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-whitepaper.pdf).\n\nStarting today, **September 10, 2018** at **10am ET**,  you will be able to convert U.S. dollars in your Gemini account into Gemini dollars and withdraw them to an Ethereum address you specify. You will also be able to automatically convert Gemini dollars into U.S. dollars by depositing them into your Gemini account.\n\nThe U.S dollars that correspond to the Gemini dollars issued and in circulation will be held at a bank located in the United States and eligible for FDIC “pass-through” deposit insurance, subject to applicable limitations. In addition, the U.S dollar deposit balance will be examined monthly by an independent registered public accounting firm to verify the 1:1 peg. All Independent Accountants’ Reports will be publicly available [here](https://gemini.com/dollar/#reports). Further, the smart contracts underlying the Gemini dollar token have been fully audited and formally verified by an independent security firm, whose report is publicly available [here](https://gemini.com/static/dollar/gemini-dollar-trailofbits-audit.pdf).\n\nWe are excited to bring the Gemini dollar to market and provide a crucial link between the traditional banking system and the new, rapidly growing crypto economy. With the Gemini dollar, we continue to deliver on our mission  —  **_to build the future of money_**  —  and help transform the global financial system to enable possibilities previously unimaginable.

For example, the National Futures Association (NFA) is an SRO for the U.S. derivatives industry and is a model for how the VCA will work together with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to provide additional oversight to virtual commodity cash markets. The promise of virtual commodities and their impact on the future will be profound — but individuals and institutions need to feel safe and secure when transacting on marketplaces. A thoughtful SRO framework that provides a virtual commodity regulatory program for the virtual commodity industry is the next logical step in the maturation of this market.\n\nWe believe adding a layer of oversight on virtual commodity cash markets, in the form of self-regulation, is important for consumer protection and to ensure the integrity of these markets. We look forward to participating in the VCA with our peers and working with industry leaders, participants, regulators, and legislators.\n\nFor further details, please read through the [VCA’s press release](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180820005066/en/Virtual-Commodity-Association-Working-Group-Formed-Planning) and visit the [VCA website](http://virtualcommodities.org/).\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a future member of the VCA or looking for more information, please email:\n\n[inquiries@virtualcommodities.org](mailto:inquiries@virtualcommodities.org).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron + Tyler","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"7bq33emKMDD3JQC4qfpwT6","blogIntroduction":"In August 2017, we migrated our trading platform to our own hardware in Equinix’s premier NY5 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey.Since then...","datePublished":"Jun 07, 2018","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"low-latency-performance-and-api-improvements","title":"Low Latency Performance and API Improvements","blogAuthors":[{"id":"2sqWkx9UPPvtY2x5FZNNBJ","authorName":"Team Gemini","authorPosition":" ","intro":"","slug":"team-gemini","profileImage":{"id":"61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW","alt":"Gemini-Headshot","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/61Jvq36bpFoOwZMfacTIvW/6c497ec70b500662d281a95887e50c4e/Team_Gemini-Headshot.png"}}],"blogType":[{"id":"gGii21AUvDcQWYUyx8EjJ","type":"Product"},{"id":"6YOO1AbXTB53ko4aLrGSGO","type":"Engineering"}],"blogHeroImage":{"id":"2L6vGoStcwHqFnBWQrgUw3","alt":"1 Kl95zxwo kWTSOthhx7N3A","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/2L6vGoStcwHqFnBWQrgUw3/b4a501887f2d6216280e9df09c3fe77e/1_Kl95zxwo_kWTSOthhx7N3A.png"},"blogPostContent":"In August 2017, we migrated our trading platform to our own hardware in Equinix’s premier NY5 data center in Secaucus, New Jersey.\n\nSince then, trade execution on our exchange has achieved **_latency to the microseconds_**.

Zcash is a friendly fork of the Bitcoin source code, making it a member of the “Nakamoto Family Tree” of virtual commodities. The Zcash protocol’s cutting edge use of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (“zk-SNARKS” or “zero-knowledge proofs”) makes it a truly innovative privacy coin that offers confidentiality for peer-to-peer transactions similar to those afforded to fiat currency transfers (e.g., ACH, FedWire, SWIFT, etc.).\n\nWe have been working closely with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to obtain approval to offer Zcash trading and custody services to our customers as a New York trust company. Our approval makes Gemini the **_first licensed Zcash exchange in the world._** It also makes the **_NYSDFS the first regulatory agency in the world to supervise Zcash_**, reaffirming their position as the leading financial regulator in the area of digital assets. Regulatory certainty and oversight are critical for both fostering innovation and protecting consumers — and we’re excited to provide our customers with a safe, secure, and regulated platform to buy, sell, and store Zcash. We are proud to be supporting this new and incredible technology, and contributing to the next generation economy and the future of money.\n\nZcash supports two types of addresses: unshielded addresses, which start with ‘t’ (i.e., “t-address”), and shielded addresses, which start with ‘z’ (i.e., “z-address”). At launch, Gemini will support deposits from unshielded or shielded addresses, but will only support withdrawals to unshielded addresses.

Starting in 2014, we worked with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to obtain a trust company license for Gemini’s exchange and custody business. In 2017, as part of the development of the [Cboe Bitcoin (USD) Futures Contract](https://gemini.com/blog/cboe-and-gemini-to-launch-first-ever-bitcoin-futures-contract-ticker-xbt/), we entered into an Information Sharing Agreement with the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE), owned by Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe) and registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to allow CFE to perform cross-market surveillance of Gemini’s marketplace. Lastly, we have adopted an internal Trading Policy with respect to material nonpublic information, as well as [Marketplace Conduct Rules](https://gemini.com/legal/user-agreement#marketplace-conduct-rules) for all trading on our marketplace, in an effort to foster a rules-based marketplace.\n\nWith that said, there has been recent discussion among U.S. regulators and legislators about the need for further oversight and self-regulation of the virtual currency industry. When evaluating this need, it is important to first note that the term virtual currency (often used interchangeably with the terms “digital asset,” “digital currency,” or “cryptocurrency”) can refer to different asset types including virtual commodities like bitcoin, and separately, tokens built “on top of” blockchains that are securities (i.e., “security tokens,” which are sometimes issued via initial coin offerings (ICOs)). The legal status of bitcoin as a commodity was established by the CFTC in the 2015 order against Coinflip, Inc. This order stated that “Bitcoin and other virtual currencies” fall under the definition of a “commodity” as defined in Section 1a(9) of the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (CEA). This was recently confirmed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. As a result, virtual commodities like bitcoin (as a group, these are referred to in this document as “virtual commodities”) are “exempt commodities,” which is the same category in which the CFTC places metals and energy commodities, including gold, silver, oil, and natural gas. The cash markets (or spot markets) for exempt commodities, including virtual commodities, do not fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC; however, the CFTC does have fraud and manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over these markets and market participants under the CEA. The legal status of whether or not a token is a security (i.e., not a virtual commodity) is determined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has traditionally been guided by the Howey Test and other SEC enforcement precedent when making these types of determinations. Unlike virtual commodities, security tokens and cash markets for security token transactions fall under the direct jurisdiction of the SEC and the federal securities laws, rules, and regulations.\n\nThe purchase and sale of commodities in the spot/cash markets has been historically exempt from the CEA and CFTC jurisdiction because cash market transactions, unlike derivative contracts, are: (i) traded for immediate delivery, (ii) settle “on the spot,” and (iii) are often underpinned by a commercial purpose (i.e., a farmer selling grain). As a result, these transactions are typically found to not be speculative in nature or readily susceptible to manipulation.\n\nCash markets for virtual commodities, however, are unique inasmuch as: (a) the commercial use-cases for virtual commodities are still developing, (b) there is strong speculative interest, © these marketplaces involve a large number of individual participants, and (d) technology makes individual transaction costs exceptionally low (on a relative basis) as compared to other physical commodity spot markets. As such, we believe adding an additional layer of oversight on virtual commodity cash markets, in the form of self-regulation, is important for consumer protection and to ensure the integrity of these markets. Below, we outline a proposal for the **Virtual Commodity Association** (the “**VCA**”), an industry sponsored self-regulatory organization for the U.S. virtual currency industry, specifically virtual commodity exchanges and custodians (collectively, “platforms”). The VCA: (i) will be a non-profit, independent regulatory organization that does not operate any markets, (ii) will not be a trade association, (iii) will not provide regulatory programs for security tokens or security token platforms, and (iv) will be in compliance with global standards and best practices for SROs.\n\nPURPOSE\n\n*   Foster financially sound, responsible, and innovative virtual commodity markets through a system of industry sponsored standards, sound practices, and oversight that promotes price discovery, efficiency, and transparency.\n*   Incentivize the detection and deterrence of manipulative and fraudulent acts and practices, including partnering with regulators and particularly the CFTC to share or refer information, as appropriate.\n*   Require member firms to commit in writing, upon joining **VCA**, to operating their virtual commodity markets in compliance with Sound Practices, described below; and provide a sanctions based accountability program to compel ongoing member compliance.\n\nSTRUCTURE — MEMBERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE\n\n*   Open for membership to virtual commodity platforms, over-the-counter (OTC) trading firms, and other trading facilities acting as counterparties that:\n*   Provide an all-to-all platform or venue, available to U.S. participants, for transacting in the spot virtual commodity markets; or\n*   Provide OTC or off-exchange services, available to U.S. participants, for transacting in the spot virtual commodity markets.\n*   When applicable, the entities must otherwise be in compliance with and have obtained relevant licenses required to operate a business that involves holding customer fiat funds and the custody of customer virtual commodities.\n*   To be governed by a Board of Directors — Board structure to come (including a required number of independent directors); funded by member fees.\n*   To consider other potential member types in the future; website to come.\n\nSOUND PRACTICES — ANNUAL CERTIFICATION BY MEMBERS\n\n*   Members shall certify to **VCA**, annually, that they are in compliance with “Sound Practices,” including:\n*   **Responsible Financial Management** — Establish a transparent program of financial responsibility and controls for members to ensure confidence in the fiscal soundness of members and to encourage customer confidence.\n*   **Transparency; Conflicts of Interest** — Provide appropriate transparency regarding bids, offers, executions, and other relevant data to the public; adopt policies to avoid conflicts of interest.\n*   **Rules Based Markets** — Maintain and enforce a system of marketplace conduct rules; and implement policies and procedures to respond to and address customer concerns and complaints.\n*   **Cyber and Information Security; Recordkeeping** — Implement and maintain current best practices with respect to cybersecurity, information security, and recordkeeping.\n*   **Surveillance** — Monitor and surveil markets to detect and deter (and where appropriate, discipline) manipulative and fraudulent acts and practices.\n*   **Information Sharing** — Agree to enter into information sharing agreements for the purposes of marketplace surveillance with other members and with regulated exchanges and trading platforms that list products based on virtual commodities.\n*   **Cooperation With Regulators** — Among other things, agree to report instances of manipulative and fraudulent conduct to the CFTC and other regulators as appropriate.\n*   **Legal Analysis** — Agree to perform proper diligence and legal analysis when determining the legal status of a virtual commodity for listing and trading in order to avoid listing and trading security tokens, unless the member has obtained necessary licenses for security tokens.\n\nPRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE VCA AND ITS BOARD\n\n*   Facilitate the periodic examination of members and issue a report indicating whether the member is adhering to its primary obligations and complying with Sound Practices;\n*   Where members fail to comply with Sound Practices, impose agreed upon sanctions; and\n*   Interact with and educate regulators (such as the CFTC or the SEC) and legislators.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe SRO approach has historically worked to protect and police various markets. For example, the National Futures Association is an SRO for the U.S. derivatives industry and is a model for how the VCA can work together with the CFTC to provide additional oversight to virtual commodity cash markets. The promise of virtual commodities and their impact on the future will be profound — but individuals and institutions need to feel safe and secure when transacting. We believe a thoughtful SRO framework that provides a virtual commodity regulatory program for the virtual commodity industry is the next logical step in the maturation of this market. We look forward to engaging with industry leaders, participants, regulators, and legislators on this proposal.

Starting on March 13, 2018 we will be enabling a new Authy feature for added security while performing sensitive transactions: Authy push notifications.\n\n#### Sessions vs transactions\n\nMost consumer-grade authentication systems operate at the level of sessions. Users provide their credentials — which may involve multiple factors such as a password in conjunction with a short-lived, one-time passcode. This initial step creates an authenticated “session” lasting for a fixed duration (e.g., one hour). During this time, users are allowed to browse around the site and use various features. After the clock runs out, the session reverts to an unauthenticated state, requiring users to prove their identity once again.\n\nOne shortcoming of this model is that after initial authentication, any number of actions are allowed within the authenticated session. Transactional authentication improves on that model by tying the authentication to a unique action. “Unique” being the operative keyword here: asking users to type their password one more time or even enter another 2FA code is not sufficient. Without knowing what will happen after completing those steps, users are effectively approving _some_ action which may not be what they had in mind.\n\nPhishing attacks and malware can exploit that disconnect. For example, in a phishing attack a user will be mistakenly interacting with a fraudulent copy of the service operated by an attacker. This fake website can:\n\n*   Collect the password\n*   Collect a 2FA code\n\nAt this point, the attacker can turn around and use those credentials (quickly, before the 2FA code expires) to login to the legitimate website to impersonate the legitimate customer.\n\nRequiring additional 2FA codes to perform sensitive actions such as authorizing a payment is not sufficient to mitigate this. The phishing site can adjust its tactics, feigning an error after collecting the initial 2FA — even though it is valid and used by attacker to login — and trick the user into giving away a _second_ 2FA code to use for authorizing the subsequent action.\n\nWhile other authentication systems such as U2F are not susceptible to phishing, they have similar limitations against malware. If the device a customer is using to access their favorite website has been compromised by malware, that malicious software can silently alter user actions. For example, it can change the Bitcoin address submitted to a web page in order to funnel payments to a different destination. Not even the proof-of-presence required in U2F by pressing a button helps. While that event cannot be fabricated by malware running on the device — the token itself registers the contact — the user is more than willing to press the button in service of the attacker. After all, they are under the impression that this action will result in some intended, legitimate behavior. In reality it is authorizing _some_ action that can be manipulated under the covers by malware. (Not to mention, malware can wait until authentication is complete to take advantage of the resulting session, complete with all required cookies and even TLS channel binding.)\n\n#### Adding context\n\nThe root cause of these problems is lack of context about the action being approved: the user believes that providing a 2FA code or pressing a button will lead to one outcome while the adversary has carefully altered the setup to trigger something else entirely. What is required is an _out-of-band channel_to verify the intended transaction, independent of the original device where it is initiated.\n\nThis is far from a new idea; there are many precedents for such verification in high-value scenarios, typically involving special purpose hardware:\n\n*   Some [cryptographic hardware tokens](https://www.ftsafe.com/products/PKI/LCD) feature a trusted display and user-interface with physical buttons to confirm transactions. That display is driven by the token and cannot be manipulated by the machine the token is attached to.\n*   Several Bitcoin hardware wallets have a display for confirming the destination addresses on transactions. Even if local malware running on the PC sends a different Bitcoin transaction for signing — as [malware in the wild](https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/cryptoshuffler-bitcoin-stealer/19976/) was discovered to be doing by manipulating the clipboard — the user has an opportunity to detect this substitution because the display cannot be manipulated.\n*   A more mainstream example can be found in NFC payments using a smart-phone. While standard credit card payments (even with chip cards) involve blindly trusting the point-of-sale terminal to charge the expected amount, mobile wallets can first [display the amount requested and obtain confirmation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=136\u0026v=S5e2EoP_irg\u0026t=1m40s) from the consumer before proceeding with the payment.\n\n#### Introducing Authy Push Notifications\n\nLuckily esoteric hardware is not required to get the benefits of out-of-band authentication. With the right application installed, the ubiquitous smart-phone can function as the independent verification channel. Authy, used by Gemini, is an example of such an app. When customers attempt to withdraw cryptocurrency from their Gemini account, they will receive an approval request on their mobile Authy app containing transaction details:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*hYv_jA7k0Sc3C1Q5.png)\n\nUnless the transaction is confirmed by clicking on the “Approve” button, no funds will be sent. Note this exchange is taking place on a completely different channel (via the Authy mobile app) than the browser session used to access Gemini. In fact, it is typically taking place on a different _device_altogether: a customer may login to the exchange on their laptop while receiving the notification on their phone. This out-of-band channel is protected from risks associated with the primary device. For example, even if a customer accidentally provides their password and 2FA code to a phishing site, that site has no way to compel that person to approve the notification requesting approval for funds transfer. More importantly, there is no way to obscure or misrepresent the intent of the transaction. Crucial details including amount and destination address will be included in the UI, giving the legitimate customer an opportunity to recognize it for what it is: an attempted theft. Similarly even malware running on the primary device can not in general cause the push notification prompt to be approved outside of user consent. (It would _also_ require compromise of the mobile device to forge that approval.)\n\n#### Roll-out plans\n\nAt this time, for customers who are already using the Authy mobile app, Gemini will require push notification approval for all crypto-currency withdrawals — no action is required to opt-in to the additional level of security. Gemini [strongly recommends all customers to use the Authy mobile app](https://gemini.com/blog/better-two-factor-authentication/) and cautions against relying on SMS for two-factor authentication.\n\nIf you have any questions, please reach out to our support team at [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nGemini Security Team","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{"metaTitle":"Authy Push Notifications for all Gemini accounts","metaDescription":"At Gemini, we take security seriously. 2FA is a requirement to ensure our customers are kept safe when performing sensitive transactions."}},{"id":"66SjoFwkjimadCLwFI8mX8","blogIntroduction":"Gemini is proud to announce the successful first settlement of January expiry Bitcoin Futures, which trade on the Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC...","datePublished":"Jan 17, 2018","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"successful-first-settlement-of-bitcoin-futures","title":"Successful First Settlement of Bitcoin Futures","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Previously, Bitcoin underwent a hard fork on August 1, 2017, splitting into two separate chains; however, both communities were in agreement as to which chain would be called _Bitcoin_, and which chain would be called _Bitcoin Cash_. All signs point to the upcoming hard fork not having the same consensus with regard to naming.\n\nIn light of this, beginning approximately one day before the anticipated time of the fork (estimated to be November 16, 2017), Gemini will temporarily disable all bitcoin withdrawals and crediting of bitcoin deposits. Both U.S. Dollar (USD) and ether (ETH) deposits and withdrawals will be unaffected.\n\nOur [policy on chain splits](https://gemini.com/blog/information-related-to-geminis-policy-on-an-upcoming-chain-split/) has been in place for several months. To reiterate what we wrote then:\n\n*   The “BTC” balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will likely reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty.\n*   We may choose to eventually open new order books for the chain with less total difficulty.\n*   We will make every effort to support withdrawals of the chain with less total difficulty, if it ends up having a significant amount of hash power, exchange volume, or economic value.\n\nWe have decided to use this existing policy for the upcoming hard fork, and we will be measuring total cumulative computational difficulty of the blockchain to determine what we will call Bitcoin and BTC and on the Gemini platform.\n\nThe cumulative computational difficulty is an objective and observable metric that is impossible to fake or “game.” It may not be a usable framework in all future chain split situations, but it works for this one. While we fully appreciate that some may disagree and have differing viewpoints on the naming of a given fork, we have yet to come across another framework that achieves the qualities mentioned above.\n\nDuring this time, our BTC/USD, ETH/USD, and ETH/BTC matching engines will remain open for trading. After at least a 48 hour period following the hard fork, once we believe the Bitcoin network has stabilized, and once we are confident that all customer funds on the exchange have been fully protected from transaction replay, we will reopen deposits and withdrawals on the network that has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty. We will then work to support withdrawals on the chain with less cumulative difficulty if it ends up having a significant amount of hash power, exchange volume, or economic value, and possibly even open new order books.\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact Gemini customer support at [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini\n\nP.S. We’ve heard a few people asking about another fork, Bitcoin Gold (BTG). We’ve done a technical evaluation of Bitcoin Gold and determined that it is still early in its software development phase. There is technically no way we could support Bitcoin Gold at this point, even if we wanted to. If Bitcoin Gold ever becomes a viable cryptocurrency, we might consider offering Bitcoin Gold withdrawal capabilities, similar to what we’ve done for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC).","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"43dgQPwlul3mROcWjc4o8i","blogIntroduction":"A little over a month ago we published an announcement regarding our ongoing engineering efforts to allow withdrawal of bitcoin cash (BCH) f...","datePublished":"Oct 07, 2017","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"bitcoin-cash-bch-withdrawals","title":"Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Withdrawals","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Instead, as stated in our August 3rd [blog post](https://gemini.com/blog/update-bitcoin-hard-fork-bitcoin-cash/), we are focusing our engineering resources on (i) ensuring that our customers’ funds are secure and not susceptible to theft (e.g., replay attacks), and (ii) building a withdrawal mechanism.\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will open a facility to allow customers to withdraw (probably on an all-or-none basis) their BCC balances to an off-platform address of their choosing.

As we’ve taken on more system load, we have had to scale up these services. On August 16th and 17th, we started hitting [Amazon’s IOPS burst quota](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html), which then cascaded to pause our core matching engine. When our matching engine paused, we were forced to bring down the rest of our system to diagnose the problem. These disruptions lasted from approximately 12:18 PM EDT to 9:30 PM EDT on August 16th and 12:40 PM EDT to 3:30 PM EDT on August 17th.\n\nThe matching engine component of the Gemini platform was the only component affected by this infrastructure failure. When we brought down the entire system for maintenance, we temporarily suspended deposit and withdrawal processing. At no time were customers funds or accounts at risk, and there was no security impact on our online and offline digital asset storage systems. To remedy this issue, we’ve increased our Amazon IOPS burst quota by over 100x and scaled up the machines that we have running the core matching engine.\n\nThis is not the first scaling challenge we’ve encountered, and it won’t be the last — but usually we’re able to resolve these sorts of issues behind the scenes. We already have a system in place to monitor for degraded exchange performance and alert our Site Reliability team so they can remediate the problem before it affects our customers. We’ve upgraded to a larger and different instance type that supports a higher IOPS burst quota and allows us to monitor it. And we’re continuing to improve our performance and infrastructure monitoring so we can anticipate potential problems more quickly in the future.\n\nWe realize that our communication during the system outage was not consistent with the quality experience you have come to expect from Gemini, and we will be improving our communication plan going forward, taking into account the feedback we’ve received.\n\nSome customer trading activity during this period was affected, and we will be reaching out to those customers within the coming days with more detailed information. If you have any questions about this outage, please don’t hesitate to [contact Gemini customer support](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) with specific details.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n\n### November 2017\n\nAs many are aware, Bitcoin attained new peaks of value on November 28th and into November 29th. On the morning of November 29th, our Web interface experienced an unprecedented increase in traffic which impacted the performance and availability of our Web interface and to a lesser extent our API servers. At no time was this increase in traffic an attack on any of our systems and our customers’ funds remain secure. This was solely a result of an unprecedented surge of requests on our platform.\n\nThroughout the events that lasted from 10:11AM EST through 07:11PM EST, we made repeated attempts to tune the system to handle the extremely high traffic on the Web server. Most of these attempts were met with new, higher spikes in activity. The API remained unimpacted during the majority of the time that our Web interface was experiencing the excessive traffic, and our FIX and matching engines continued to fully operate throughout.\n\nThe environment stabilized at 7:11PM EST and, after monitoring the mitigation for a period of time, we communicated to our customers at 8:45PM EST on our [status page](https://status.gemini.com/) that both our Web and API interfaces were in full functioning order.\n\nAs many of you may know, in August we migrated our primary trading platform and network PoP (Point of Presence) to our own hardware in the [Equinix NY5](https://docs.gemini.com/fix-marketdata/#connecting) data center in Secaucus, New Jersey. The downtime on November 29th was due to an application tuning issue, and our servers in the data center had plenty of room to scale. Still, in preparation for events such as the one above, we have forecasted and prepared for increasing capacity and were already installing our new hardware when this occurred. We plan to bring this new capacity online in the near future to continue scaling our infrastructure to better service our customers and community. The security and availability of our Web, API, and FIX interfaces is our first concern and we strive to have them available for all our customers at all times.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"rpa3nHzKojGTrlbmZovQN","blogIntroduction":"Since the “hard fork” on August 1st, 2017, we have been monitoring the situation closely.

Encouraged by its success and ability to match buyers and sellers at a single moment of the day, we launched an East Asian Timezone daily auction on March 21, 2017. We would now like to offer the same kind of price discovery we have facilitated for bitcoin traders over the past year for ether traders. As a result, we will be launching a daily 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time [**_ether auction_**](https://gemini.com/prices/ethereum \"Ether Price Page\") starting on Friday, July 28, 2017! The mechanics will be the same as our bitcoin auctions; please see [https://gemini.com/marketplace/#auction](https://gemini.com/marketplace/#auction) for details.\n\nDaily auctions are universally implemented by traditional asset exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and Bats. They increase price discovery and transparency, and they reduce costs across the board by making sure that buyers and sellers don’t miss each other during the trading day. In addition, we are confident that our Auction will bring you the benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) trading without the overhead, hassle, and lack of transparency.\n\n#### How Do Auctions Benefit Gemini Customers?\n\nAuctions aim to facilitate high volumes of trading between customers at a fair price by matching the maximum quantity to be bought and sold. Auctions provide the following benefits to our customers:\n\n*   **Greater Price Discovery**: Auctions focus market participants and economic information at a single moment in the day, resulting in better price discovery.\n*   **Deeper Liquidity**: Execute larger trades with less market price impact or “slippage.” Because Auctions are at a single moment in the day, more buyers and sellers are able to converge and provide more liquidity on both sides of the market.\n*   **Mark-to-Market Benchmark Price:** Auctions provide an official 4:00 p.m. ET end-of-day price for marking assets to market (e.g., for accounting purposes or for calculating returns).\n*   **Instant Settlement:** Auction trades settle immediately and funds are ready for immediate transfer (unlike OTC trades that can require phone calls, emails, specialized paperwork, risk during funds transfer, etc.).\n*   **No Counterparty Risk:** Auction trades settle immediately from pre-funded accounts, eliminating the risk that your counterparty will back out of a trade (unlike OTC trades which are typically not pre-funded).\n\n#### How Do Auctions Work?\n\nAll eligible orders are filled at the _final auction price_. The _final auction price_ of each Auction is determined by finding the price at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and aggregate sell demand from all participating orders can be filled (i.e., the price at which the largest quantity can trade). The mechanics of this auction are very similar to the closing auction (or “closing cross”) on the major electronic U.S. stock exchanges (e.g., Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, Bats). For a more detailed discussion, please see our [Marketplace](https://gemini.com/marketplace/) page.\n\n#### How Can You Participate in Auctions?\n\nEasy! Customers can enter Auction-Only (AO) Market and Auction-Only (AO) Limit Orders to buy or to sell beginning well before the Auction time.\n\nBeginning 10 minutes before the Auction time, _indicative auction prices_ are broadcast via both our market data API and our website frontend. A new _indicative auction price_ is calculated every minute until the Auction time, based on the order book at that time, and every 15 seconds during the final minute. (These indicative prices are calculated by simulating the auction process for the order books if Auction were to occur at that time.)\n\n#### How to Buy or Sell Large Quantities in Gemini’s Daily Auctions:\n\nLeading up to auction, liquidity providers place Auction-Only Orders on both the bid side and offer side of the market . These liquidity providers often compete for greater influence in the auction by tightening these spreads. That ultimately benefits all Auction participants.\n\nThese liquidity providers also monitor the _indicative auction prices_. If they observe new liquidity demands in a particular Auction, they stand ready to modify their own Auction-Only Orders in order to facilitate liquidity demands. If you want to buy or sell a large quantity during one of the Auctions, we therefore recommend that you submit it approximately 10 minutes before the Auction time. This will give liquidity providers time to respond and to give your order access to increased liquidity.\n\n#### Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions regarding Auction mechanics or the benefits that Auction may provide you, please check out our [Marketplace](https://gemini.com/marketplace/) page for a detailed description, or contact [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"6FLVKJ1CSHPm0MdXde0COF","blogIntroduction":"UPDATED 7/26/17 3:30 PM EDT.A number of customers have asked how Gemini will respond if the Bitcoin network splits into two separate Blockch...","datePublished":"Mar 20, 2017","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"information-related-to-geminis-policy-on-an-upcoming-chain-split","title":"Information related to Gemini’s policy on an upcoming Chain Split","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Our highest priority at Gemini — more important even than keeping our exchange open — is ensuring that all of our customers’ asset balances are held securely.\n\nWe know that some of our customers have strong opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve. At Gemini, however, it’s not our place to drive the discussion. In the event of a chain split, we will carefully consider our response and how to move forward. We understand that our customers have diverse opinions on this subject, and we will do our best to incorporate your suggestions.\n\nWe certainly _prefer_ and _encourage_ a “clean” chain split, no matter which side of the scaling debate wins, but we are preparing for a variety of outcomes. In the event that we detect a chain split or anticipate an imminent chain split, we will temporarily suspend BTC deposits and withdrawals. During that time, we will evaluate our response and post updates here on this blog. We will endeavor to resume deposits and withdrawals as soon as we’re safely able to do so, but that process may take up to a week to complete.\n\nHowever, as an indication of what we are currently planning:\n\n*   The “BTC” balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will _likely_ reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty.\n*   We may choose to eventually open new order books for the chain with less total difficulty.\n*   We will make _every effort_ to support withdrawals of the chain with less total difficulty, if it ends up having a significant amount of hashpower, exchange volume, or economic value.\n\nWe understand that the policies listed above leave quite a lot to Gemini’s discretion. We would rather have clearly defined policies in place right now; however, it’s unclear what will happen on the Blockchain in the coming days, weeks, and months, and we would much rather play it safe than make hasty, ill-informed decisions and risk mismanaging your funds. As soon as we gain further insight on the situation, we will make additional blog posts to better detail how your funds on Gemini will be secured.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"7vaFu9UFyk4Xlamfq0PU8C","blogIntroduction":"We have required all of our customers to use two-factor authentication (2FA) from day one.

In keeping with our security-first philosophy of protecting and educating our customers, we want to provide some background on our 2FA system **_to encourage our customers to use the Authy app for 2FA rather than SMS_**, and to dispel some common misconceptions.\n\n#### About Authy\n\nGemini uses the [Authy service](https://www.authy.com/product/) for 2FA. Authy is an independent cloud service called on to perform secondary verification once we have checked that a customer has provided correct login credentials (i.e., email and password).\n\nAuthy offers multiple options for second-factor verification:\n\n1.  **SMS**: One-time passcodes (OTPs) are delivered via text message.\n2.  **Voice**: Similar to SMS, with the codes read aloud by an automated text-to-speech system.\n3.  **Mobile application**: Users install an app (or Chrome extension), which generates an OTP based on a secret “seed” and current time according to the TOTP standard. TOTP is an [open standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) implemented by multiple apps including [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2\u0026hl=en) [and the Authy app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2\u0026hl=en).\n4.  **OneTouch**: Pioneered by [Duo Push](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/authentication-methods/duo-push), this model dispenses with codes altogether. Instead users confirm a login by responding to a simple yes/no prompt.\n\nEach of these options comes with different tradeoffs. **SMS** is simple and can work on any mobile phone including legacy flip-phones that are not “smart” and don’t have an application ecosystem. **Voice** codes further improve accessibility by allowing codes to be sent to landlines or heard by users who have difficulty with visual information.\n\n**TOTP** codes generated using an app do not require internet connectivity. TOTP apps can work offline, even if the phone itself has no service (e.g., when a user is outside a service area). **OneTouch** further improves usability by avoiding the need to transcribe digits from one device to another, but (unlike TOTP) it does require a data connection.\n\n#### Encouraging Mobile Apps\n\nGemini has always supported SMS and mobile app options for 2FA. However, in recent interactions with customers, the Gemini support team reached the conclusion that many customers were either not aware of the Authy mobile app, incorrectly viewed SMS as equivalently secure to the Authy app, or were interested in other alternative TOTP apps. We are now actively encouraging all of our customers to install the Authy app. We believe that **_switching to the Authy app will improve security without any downside to usability_** for nearly all customers, as discussed below.\n\nAt the same time, we recognize there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Customers may have unique requirements which rule out the Authy mobile app, so we will continue to support SMS. However, once you have Authy installed, you will no longer be able to request codes via SMS. We’re doing this to prevent would-be attackers from circumventing the security of the Authy app by falling back to SMS.\n\n#### Risks Associated with SMS\n\nA 2003 [ruling](https://www.fcc.gov/general/wireless-local-number-portability-wlnp) by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) called for number portability between wireless carriers, which allows consumers to keep their existing phone number when they switch from one wireless carrier to another wireless carrier. Number portability increased competition between wireless carriers by removing one of the major obstacles that prevents consumers from switching to a better plan: the hassle of losing their existing phone number. The FTC ruling made it much easier for consumers to keep their number while switching carriers — too easy, perhaps. Call it the law of unintended consequences: the drive to portability also inadvertently opened the door to [number-porting attacks](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/06/your-mobile-phone-account-could-be-hijacked-identity-thief).\n\nLast July, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) came out with a [recommendation](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html) to deprecate the use of SMS for 2FA. Almost on cue, the industry experienced an uptick in the incidence of phone number hijacking events. In this type of fraud, a miscreant impersonates the legitimate customer and ports his or her number to a _different_ carrier, pretending to be that person switching carriers. If the attacker is successful in convincing the other carrier to reassign the number to an attacker-controlled device, all voice calls and SMS messages will be routed to the perpetrator. As a result, _any_ 2FA system relying on SMS or voice for delivering one-time passcodes is susceptible to such attacks.\n\n#### Setting up the Authy Mobile App\n\nSetting up the Authy mobile app eliminates the risks associated with using SMS for 2FA, however, to fully mitigate SMS vulnerabilities **_you need to make sure you_** [**_turn off_**](https://gemini24.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000053543-Turning-off-Authy-Multi-Device-Support) **_“multi-device” in the Authy app._** This prevents the same number-porting attack (mentioned above) from being used to obtain access to your SMS messages to perform an unauthorized install of your Authy account. When it is turned off, no additional instances of the Authy app can be provisioned. We recommend all Gemini customers to keep multi-device disabled, only enabling it **_temporarily_** when setting up a new device (for example, when upgrading your phone). If you’re resetting or trading in your phone, we also recommend that you install the [Authy desktop app](https://www.authy.com/app/desktop/) first, so that you can use it to authorize your new phone. We are also working with the Authy team to make the process of switching or upgrading devices easier and more secure for all Gemini customers, regardless of your multi-device settings.\n\n#### Looking Forward\n\nWhile using a mobile app to generate codes is an improvement, there are other attack vectors that no 2FA solution based on one-time passcodes (OTPs) can solve. For example, sophisticated phishing attacks can ask users to disclose _both_ their password and an OTP code. This type of phishing is more complex because it requires real-time use of compromised credentials. Since OTPs expire after a short time period, it is not possible to stash the stolen credentials for later use. Despite that added complexity, such attacks are not only feasible in principle but they have been [observed in the wild](https://citizenlab.org/2015/08/iran_two_factor_phishing/) against popular 2FA implementations including those used by Google and some large financial services companies.\n\nThese risks cannot be addressed by changing how one-time passcodes are generated or delivered. As long as the possibility exists for a user to be tricked into entering codes into the wrong website, phishing remains a viable attack. For these reasons, **_we are continuing to explore alternative 2FA paradigms such as U2F or Authy OneTouch for Gemini_** which are based on fundamentally different models. (Case in point: our _internal_ systems for administering the exchange use public-key authentication with hardware tokens based on the [PIV standard](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/piv/standards.html).) Our priority is to find a solution that combines high security and usability, and is available to our customers across a broad range of platforms.","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4tsZ1ahGkvuBKaro7MRObT","blogIntroduction":"Gemini now offers three different protocols to connect to our trading system: REST API, WebSockets API, and FIX.

Many customers such as hedge funds, mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds may be required by law to store their digital assets with a regulated custodian like Gemini in separate and dedicated custodial accounts (i.e. unique Bitcoin addresses that are not commingled in a pooled account). As a limited purpose trust company, Gemini is uniquely positioned to legally and securely custody digital assets on behalf of customers with these specific needs. These **Segregated Accounts**, like Gemini **Depository Accounts**, leverage our proprietary offline (i.e., air-gapped) Cold Storage system for both bitcoin and ether.\n\nWhile security has always been a fundamental concern in the cryptocurrency community, recent large-scale thefts and uncertainty regarding exchanges’ legal obligation to customers have further highlighted the necessity of providing a legal and secure means of storing digital assets. Since we first launched, our paramount concern has always been protecting the integrity of our customers’ funds, and this has motivated our uncompromising commitment to financial security and regulatory oversight. We’re excited to continue to expand upon our mission of offering safe and regulated custodial services for digital assets.\n\nFor more details on Segregated Accounts, please visit our [Custody page](https://gemini.com/custody) or email [custody@gemini.com](mailto:custody@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4taSGcRFP7L4vAVQ3FMK1R","blogIntroduction":"**UPDATED: Please see our Marketplace Page for the most current information regarding our Daily Bitcoin Auction.**While bitcoin is a tremend...","datePublished":"Sep 21, 2016","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"introducing-the-first-ever-daily-bitcoin-auction","title":"*UPDATED* Introducing the First-Ever Daily Bitcoin Auction","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

So how do we fix this? By building the first-ever daily bitcoin **_Auction_** — now live for trading!\n\nAuctions (also called “crosses,” not to be confused with winner-take-all auctions) are events which allow two-sided trading in large or small blocks with efficient price discovery and reduced price slippage. The goal is to prevent buyers and sellers from missing each other during the trading day. Auctions are universally implemented by traditional asset exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, and Bats. In addition, we are confident that our Auction will bring you the benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) trading without the overhead, hassle, and lack of transparency of these archaic trading venues.\n\n#### How Does Auction Benefit Gemini Customers?\n\nAuction is a new mechanism for electronic trading on Gemini that will occur at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time _every_ day (including weekends and holidays). At first we’ll support only the BTC/USD trading pair, but we’ll open it for all our trading pairs in the coming weeks. Auction aims to facilitate high volumes of trading between customers at a fair price by matching the maximum quantity to be bought and sold.\n\nAuction provides the following benefits to our customers:\n\n*   **Greater Price Discovery**: Auction focuses market participants and economic information at a single moment in the day, resulting in better price discovery.\n*   **Mark-to-Market Benchmark Price:** Auction provides an official 4:00 p.m. ET end-of-day price for marking assets to market (e.g., for accounting purposes or for calculating returns).\n*   **Lower Fees:** Auction trades receive our [liquidity-making fee discounts](https://gemini.com/fees) and are therefore eligible for up to a 15 bps (0.15%) rebate (unlike OTC trades that can cost upwards of 1–2% per trade).\n*   **Instant Settlement:** Auction trades settle immediately and funds are ready for immediate transfer (unlike OTC trades that can require phone calls, emails, specialized paperwork, risk during funds transfer, etc.).\n*   **No Counterparty Risk:** Auction trades settle immediately from pre-funded accounts, eliminating the risk that your counterparty will back out of a trade (unlike OTC trades which are typically not pre-funded).\n\n#### How Does Auction Work?\n\nAll eligible orders will be filled at the _final auction price_ at 4:00 p.m. ET. The _final auction price_ of each Auction is determined by finding the price at which the greatest aggregate buy demand and aggregate sell demand from all participating orders can be filled (i.e., the price at which the largest quantity can trade). The mechanics of this auction are very similar to the closing auction (or closing “cross”) on the major electronic U.S. stock exchanges (e.g., Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, Bats). For a more detailed discussion, please see [Marketplace](https://gemini.com/marketplace/#auction).\n\n#### How Can You Participate in Auction?\n\nEasy! Customers can enter Auction-Only Market and Auction-Only Limit Orders to buy or to sell beginning at 5:00 p.m. ET the prior day until 4:00 p.m ET for that day’s Auction. (E.g., for Wednesday’s Auction, you can place orders between **Tuesday** at **5:00 p.m. ET** and **Wednesday** at **4:00 p.m. ET**).\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*6ix-xfXD6En1q6_N.png)\n\nBeginning at 3:50 p.m. ET each day, _indicative auction prices_ are broadcast via both our market data API and our website frontend. A new _indicative auction price_ is calculated every minute until 3:59 p.m. ET based on the order book at that time. (These indicative prices are calculated by simulating the auction process for the order books if Auction were to occur at that time.)\n\n#### Example Auction:\n\nAt exactly 4:00 p.m. ET, the Auction-Only order book contains the following limit orders, listed in the order they were submitted:\n\n**CustomerDirectionQuantity (BTC)Limit Price**\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YudzKwTk55BiCSf9UgDpdg.png)\n\nTo determine the _final auction price_, find the price level that maximizes the _matched volume_ (i.e., the price at which the largest quantity can trade). The _matched volume_ at a particular price level is how much interest can cross between buy orders and sell orders, and is therefore the lesser of the available buy or sell interest at that price level.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6ZnS4vgSz20aw4GhTqjv2g.png)\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nHjE2HKM1_Fh1Pnc.png)\n\nIn this example, the matched quantity is greatest at all prices between $600 and $610. Therefore, the _final auction price_ is determined to be $605 (the midrange between these two prices), with a _matched volume_ of 3,250 BTC. All available sellers who can trade at $605 are fully filled: Bob (1,000 BTC), Grace (1,000 BTC), and Sybil (1,250 BTC). Because the buy interest at this price is greater than the sell interest, one of the buyers is partially filled, based on time priority: Frank receives 2,250 BTC rather than 2,500 BTC, but Charlie is fully filled (1,000 BTC).\n\n#### Questions?\n\nIf you have any questions regarding Auction mechanics or the benefits that Auction may provide you, please check out [Marketplace](https://gemini.com/marketplace/) for a detailed description or contact [support@gemini.com](mailto:support@gemini.com).\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"4JPNeB745mOlCl14GBuPtt","blogIntroduction":"Two weeks ago we made an announcement regarding our ongoing work to allow withdrawal of ETC (Ether Classic or ETHC) for customers who had et...","datePublished":"Aug 12, 2016","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"update-2-ether-classic-withdrawals","title":"UPDATE #2: Ether Classic Withdrawals","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

We want your interaction with Gemini to be as efficient and user-friendly as possible — this goes back to our core principle of giving you **_what you need, when you need it_**. There’s a lot of data to show, and we have a wide range of features, so we’ve completely redesigned and restructured [our entire public site](https://gemini.com/) and [this blog](https://gemini.com/blog/) from the ground up. Hopefully you’ll agree that information is now easier to find and consume, and that your experience in navigating the Gemini website is seamless, relevant, and enjoyable!\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ieQSHNoufxET2CXn.png)\n\n#### Maker-or-Cancel and Immediate-or-Cancel Orders\n\nAt Gemini, we’re not big fans of the trend towards more and more complicated order types on exchanges. We think it’s important to keep the rules of our exchange simple. Whether you’re buying, selling, or speculating on Gemini, you can be confident that you’re being treated fairly and on a level playing field with everyone else.\n\nWith that in mind, when we see requests for new exchange features, we evaluate them critically to ensure they won’t disrupt the fairness, performance, or simplicity of the our exchange. Today, we’re offering two new order options: **_maker-or-cancel_**\\* and **_immediate-or-cancel_**. They let you specify that your order should either be only liquidity-making or only liquidity-taking.\n\nThese new order options are available now; you can learn more about them from our [API documentation](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#new-order).\n\n#### What’s Coming Next\n\nSo far, in just the first quarter of 2016, we’ve released:\n\n*   [Our new Activity Feed](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-the-new-gemini-activity-feed/)\n*   [Multi-user accounts](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-multi-user-accounts-and-performance-upgrades/)\n*   [Instant bank account verification](https://gemini.com/blog/funding-your-gemini-account-just-got-a-lot-faster/)\n*   [Volume and ratio-based fee discounts](https://gemini.com/blog/new-fee-and-rebate-schedule/)\n*   [Multiple bank account support](https://gemini.com/blog/introducing-multiple-bank-accounts/)\n*   [Instant ACH deposits](https://gemini.com/blog/instant-ach-deposits-are-here/)\n*   [FIX API](https://gemini.com/blog/we-now-offer-a-fix-api-and-support-websockets/)\n*   [WebSockets market data API](https://gemini.com/blog/we-now-offer-a-fix-api-and-support-websockets/)\n\nWe’ve been progressing at a pretty breakneck pace so far this year — but you might not hear from us as often over the next couple weeks. We have a few huge, groundbreaking new features in the works, and while they may take a little more time to deliver, we’re really excited about the changes ahead and can’t wait to share them with you.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nEric Winer\n\n_\\* Note: exchanges in other asset classes sometimes call this order type “post-only,” although the precise functionality may vary._","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"3v1jTtO3Gl7WM2gwZ1cD3b","blogIntroduction":"We built our current JSON-based API primarily for customers who are already familiar with trading on Bitcoin exchanges.

But there are plenty of traders who trade on markets all over the world but aren’t familiar with the world of Bitcoin and simply aren’t able or willing to connect to an exchange over the public internet. So to help a whole new class of individuals and institutions enter the Bitcoin ecosystem and trade Bitcoin even faster, we’re now offering support for the [FIX protocol](https://docs.gemini.com/fix-api/).\n\nIf you’d like to connect with FIX, please email us at [hello@gemini.com](mailto:hello@gemini.com). We’ll get you set up with an IPSec VPN into our [Sandbox environment](https://exchange.sandbox.gemini.com/register), so you can test your trading software and complete our FIX certification process. Full documentation is available in draft form at [https://docs.gemini.com/fix-api](https://docs.gemini.com/fix-api/). Once you’re certified, to use FIX for trading you’ll need to [connect directly](https://docs.gemini.com/fix-api/#connecting) to our datacenter in Secaucus, New Jersey via co-location cross-connect, extranet, or private line Ethernet.\n\nWe’ve heard some requests to use a FIX API over the public internet. However, our security, infrastructure, and engineering teams all agreed that that was an awkward (and potentially insecure) use of the protocol. So to accommodate users on the public internet, we’re also working on improving our JSON-based API, as you’ll see below. If you have any questions or comments, please don’t hesitate to send us an email at [hello@gemini.com](mailto:hello@gemini.com).\n\n#### WEBSOCKETS STREAMING MARKET DATA\n\nIf you’re an JSON-based API user, there’s no need to constantly query for the latest order book and trade information anymore. We now offer [WebSockets](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#streaming-market-data)for streaming market data of our public order book and the latest trades on Gemini. This makes it easier to keep an accurate and up-to-date view of our order book. Please see our documentation for more information:\n\n[https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#streaming-market-data](https://docs.gemini.com/rest-api/#streaming-market-data)\n\nOr check out a [live demo](https://jsfiddle.net/9sutecyv/). Please test it out and let us know if you have any questions or feedback at [hello@gemini.com](mailto:hello@gemini.com).","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"lNIgVjLjqE6MqN8JzUCph","blogIntroduction":"We recently made depositing bitcoin a lot faster — and now we are making depositing dollars faster too!

We’re going to be using that section of the website more and more in the future to get you the information you need when you want it as you trade bitcoin.\n\n#### PERFORMANCE UPGRADE\n\nAt the same time, we also greatly improved the performance of our core exchange engine. We didn’t want to make a big deal of it until collecting some data after the release, but now we’ve gone back and taken a look at those before-and-after numbers. Measuring the round-trip time for order placement and order cancellation through our API, we’re seeing:\n\n*   a ~40–60% decrease in median round-trip time\n*   a ~45% decrease in the standard deviation\n\n#### MULTI-USER / SUB ACCOUNTS\n\nThis past weekend, we released one of your most commonly requested features: multiple-user accounts (i.e., sub accounts of one master account). Now, multiple people within an organization can register for Gemini and share access to the same trading account. Administrators can grant each user a different access level depending on their role in the organization (e.g., manager, trader, auditor). To get started, just head to the [User Management](https://exchange.gemini.com/settings/users) page, or click User Management from the settings menu in the upper right corner of the Gemini [dashboard](https://exchange.gemini.com/):  \nFrom there, you can invite new users to your account and assign each one an access level. The currently available access levels and their capabilities are outlined in the table below:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ttLtOrLi9299MBFx.png)\n\nIf there are any access levels you would like us to add or change, please get in touch at hello@gemini.com.\n\nYou’re welcome to use these new features even if, like most Gemini users, you have a Gemini personal account. For instance, you can invite your family to join your account, so you all can buy \u0026 sell bitcoin and share a common account balance. If you are currently using your Gemini personal account to conduct business, please get in touch with us at hello@gemini.com so we can work with you to upgrade your account to an institutional one.\n\nAnd even if you don’t use our new User Management features, there’s a lot more in store over the next few months. Our engineering team is currently hard at work to bring you new connectivity options, faster deposits and withdrawals, and, at long last, new currencies to trade. At the same time, our intrepid legal team is hard at work getting Gemini approved to operate in all 50 states, as well as, around the world.\n\nIt’s going to be an exciting year for Gemini, and I hope you’ll join us for the ride.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nEric Winer","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"6HMTbWvCX29oN69Ii2PrDV","blogIntroduction":"This past Friday, we launched the second version of our activity feed.

We thought now would be a good time to share our thinking behind it, as well as our overall design philosophy at Gemini. From the beginning, our design approach has centered around creating a powerful yet elegant interface that focuses on the core principle of giving you **what you need, when you need it**. Whether you are an individual or an institution, you will always have relevant information available to you at a glance.\n\nVersions of this exist in many forms around the web, ranging from Facebook-like news feeds all the way to simple email alerts — you have come to expect this type of design from many of the services you use today — and your bitcoin trading platform should be no different. Enter the Gemini Activity Feed, a collapsible feed that is populated with all of your actions and relevant alerts. From the onset, we wanted to avoid stuffing information in the header, hiding it in menus or making information only available on specific pages. In short, the Gemini Activity Feed is an accessible aggregation of relevant user information.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*LnQpnmMORnrRg5kT.png)\n\nThe original structure of the feed involved 1) your account values and 2) your account actions. We designed this feed to be a proof of concept where all actionable items were listed as they happened. Doing it this way gave us the most flexibility and proved to be very useful, however, we quickly found certain items hard to parse, which made the feed at times frustrating to use.\n\n#### The Evolution\n\nOnce we gathered enough customer feedback and understood the pain-points of using the original Gemini Activity Feed, we had clear direction on the improvements we needed to make. On top of that, there were some opportunistic additions that made it into this release.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MGAVzhQkZxsLI4q3.jpg)\n\n**_Easier Parsing of Feed Items_**\n\nOur previous activity feed was text-based, making it very difficult to find or distinguish between say, a placed limit order or a newly created API key. We decided to make a visual distinction between item types so our customers could easily parse them. As a result, we ended up creating branded iconography to help customers differentiate.\n\n**_Multiple Currency Display (Spoiler Alert!)_**\n\nPreviously, we were locked into only displaying your USD and BTC balances. We reformatted the header area to better accommodate the addition of other (soon to be supported) fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.\n\n**_Open Order Notifications_**\n\nWe also wanted to display open orders (i.e., unfilled buy or sell orders). When a limit order is placed but unfulfilled, a notification will now persist in the header of the activity feed. At a glance, the user will know how many open orders they have and how much of their funds are being held.\n\nNaturally, we will continue to see how people engage with their feeds and incorporate customer feedback for future releases. We always welcome input, and are always looking to improve so thanks for all of your input so far!\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nMarcus Skala","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2NwZaemlUBdunpVzR2c4FT","blogIntroduction":"We are writing to clarify our policies and procedures around market disruptions, and to address the large market buy order that was placed b...","datePublished":"Nov 19, 2015","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"our-guidelines-for-trade-reversals","title":"Our Guidelines For Trade Reversals","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

This single order drove up the price per bitcoin on Gemini to as high as $2,200.00 (i.e., ~$1,800.00 dollars above the then current market price), and after careful consideration, it was subsequently reversed. Upon making our determination, we immediately alerted all counterparties involved and have been working diligently to ensure the most equitable resolution possible. We have also been working on building and implementing a strategy to prevent and help mitigate similar situations in the future. It has been no small undertaking, and we greatly appreciate your patience, apologize for any inconvenience and for the delay in our response communication, and understand how some may disagree with our decision. With that said, in an effort to be as transparent as possible, we will outline why we decided to unwind this trade, what we are doing to prevent this from happening in the future, and what customers can expect in the event something like this happens again.\n\n#### GUIDELINES FOR TRADE REVERSALS\n\nThere are a number of situations which can cause markets to do unusual things — these can include, but are not limited to, a fat-finger order, an algorithm run amok, or a software bug. It’s difficult to give hard and fast rules for each of these scenarios, many of which can be grey areas; however, this particular case is fairly clear. The customer who placed this order made a trade that was empirically **_disruptive_** to an orderly market — in this case achieving a price of ~$2,200.00 or ~700% above the then current market price per bitcoin — representing a false and misleading view of the market. We did not base our decision on the _reason_ this order was placed (though we have no evidence to believe it was intentionally malicious), only whether or not it was disruptive. Our decision was also not based on _customer type_, although, since it has been asked, we will share that the customer was not an institution, not a special customer, but rather an regular individual customer just like many others on our platform.\n\nWhile it is impossible to create guidelines for every potential situation, it is possible to make an affirmative statement with respect to this specific class of erroneous trade. Small orders can be mistakes too, but most will not disrupt an orderly market. What exactly constitutes disruptive is not always entirely clear, but what happened Friday was clearly one of these examples.\n\n#### OUR USER AGREEMENT\n\nBecause issues such as this one can arise in any marketplace from time to time, our User Agreement states the following:\n\n\u003e “We retain the right to enter pricing, order, and reconciliation adjustments as necessary and appropriate.”\n\n\u003e _(_See  **_Account Statements_** _section)_\n\n\u003e “We reserve the right to reverse and/or cancel one or more Orders in the event of (i) any disruption or malfunction in the operation of any electronic communications, trading facilities, storage facilities, recording mechanisms or other components of or integral to Gemini or of Digital Assets, or (ii) any other severe business disruption to Gemini, its systems or Digital Assets, where the nullification of transactions may be necessary for the maintenance of a fair and orderly market or the protection of you and the public interest.”\n\n\u003e _(_See  **_System Disruptions Or Malfunctions_** _section)_\n\nHaving the ability to adjust orders, handle clearly erroneous trades and the ability to halt or delay trades during a disruption to an orderly market are **_market safeguards that are neither exclusive nor unique to Gemini_**, but rather common practice among many well-established and regulated exchanges such as the [NYSE](http://blogs.barrons.com/stockstowatchtoday/2014/11/18/whoops-looks-like-a-fat-finger-caused-a-10-flash-crash-in-home-depot/) and [NASDAQ](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/03/us-markets-nasdaq-kraft-idUSBRE89213H20121003#x6WDcRESOzDTbm47.97).\n\n#### IMPLEMENTING PRE-TRADE CONTROLS\n\nWe will be implementing the following pre-trade controls in an effort to prevent similarly disruptive situations going forward. These include:\n\n1.  Automatic cancellation of the remaining portion of any order that immediately moves the market price by more than **20%** in either direction; and\n2.  The addition of a confirmation dialogue box that warns customers before placing any order that could potentially move the market price by more than **20%** in either direction\n\n#### POST-TRADE ACTIONS\n\nWhile we believe these new pre-trade controls will greatly help prevent problematic trades in the future, it is impossible to predict all potential corner cases that could be disruptive to an orderly marketplace (the very reason why exchanges employ the safeguards mentioned above). As a result, we are planning to take the following steps:\n\n1.  For this event, we will be removing the record of these reversed trades from our market data API and the historical trade data on our website.\n2.  If you were a party to this trade, we’ve already been in touch with you — you will still see a record of your portion of this trade and its reversal in your account history.\n3.  Version 2.0 of our API is already in development and we will look to incorporate more specific detailed accounting for any future reversed trades.\n\nWe understand and have considered both sides of the bitcoin, so to speak, with respect to this issue and recognize that not everyone will agree with the actions we have taken. Unfortunately, no solution is perfect here. But when taking into account the relevant facts, we felt that reversing this trade was more in line with the spirit of what we intended when we set out to build Gemini — namely, a safe and secure marketplace for all customers to buy and sell bitcoin.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron and Tyler","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"7CnSaHGAUHHPDTBOK7SbZP","blogIntroduction":"We are excited to announce that Gemini has opened its doors to both individual and institutional customers.

Trading officially begins on **Thursday, October 8th at 9:30 a.m EDT / 6:30 a.m. PDT.** If you haven’t done so already, you can create your account by going to the [Gemini homepage](https://gemini.com/) and clicking on “Create Your Account”.\n\nSome of you may be wondering what we’ve been up to since we first announced our plans for Gemini on January 23, 2015. That’s a great question — we have been hard at work building the four pillars of our business:\n\n**1) Product, 2) Security, 3) Licensing and 4) Compliance.**\n\nSo was it worth the wait? We think so. As a bitcoin exchange we don’t always have the ability to “fail fast” or the freedom to “hack” our way through product development, security or licensing. When you are dealing with money — especially other people’s money — you simply cannot assemble the rocket ship mid-flight.\n\nMeeting the high-water mark of banking compliance is no small task, especially for a startup, but we felt that doing so was crucial — Bitcoin is an island right now, and if we are going to build a bridge to the financial mainland, then Gemini must look and feel as safe, secure, and compliant as any other top tier financial institution in the world. This includes, among other things, creating a robust [anti-money laundering (AML) program](https://gemini.com/legal/bsa-aml-program#bank), strong internal controls and procedures, a comprehensive [security program](https://gemini.com/security) and maintaining significant capital reserves.\n\nIn short, we take licensing and compliance _very_ seriously and think that asking for permission, rather than forgiveness is the right approach in this case — and we think our customers will agree. The end result is Gemini Trust Company LLC, a New York state limited liability trust company, which makes us a fiduciary, and allows us to accept both **individual** and **institutional** customers under New York Banking Law (unlike the BitLicense, which does not convey such fiduciary powers).\n\nInitially, Gemini will be operating in [26 US states and in Washington, DC](https://gemini.com/areas-of-operation). We plan to expand our coverage area rapidly, so stay tuned.\n\nLastly, we speak for everyone on our team when we say that we couldn’t be more proud of what we’ve built over the past year and more excited to begin serving you, one Satoshi at a time.\n\nOnward and Upward,\n\nCameron and Tyler","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"6tEnHOiYYvjbLdNdf5fEj","blogIntroduction":"NOTE: Information from this post has been consolidated and moved to the Areas of Operation page...","datePublished":"Oct 05, 2015","isLargeFeatured":false,"isSmallFeatured":false,"showSimilarArticles":true,"showMoreNews":true,"showMoreFromAuthors":true,"showLatestNews":true,"slug":"geminis-area-of-operation","title":"Areas of Operation ","blogAuthors":[{"id":"hiPe0E1bLn4sELNywrwI8","authorName":"Cameron Winklevoss","authorPosition":"President ","intro":"Cameron Winklevoss is co-founder and President of Gemini, a crypto platform that allows customers to buy, sell, store, and store digital assets such as bitcoin and ether.

Perhaps more so than credit-cards, ACH or any other payment systems, Bitcoin is the one payment technology where possession of money can be boiled down to pure cryptographic capability: generating a signature with an ECDSA private key _is money_. If you lose control of that private key, you lose the ability to spend your funds, plain and simple.\n\nWith adoption of strong cryptography, direct attacks against cryptographic algorithms and protocols have become increasingly rare, although not extinct, as demonstrated by WEP, MD5, GSM encryption and the never-ending saga of TLS vulnerabilities. Far more common, however, are system failures caused by inadequate key management (i.e. when secrets are mishandled) that allow attackers to bypass the cryptography altogether. To that end, Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) have been promoted as best practice for implementing strict control over private keys. An HSM is a special-purpose, tamper-resistant device for managing cryptographic keys. They are not general-purpose computers meant for everyday use or extensibility; there is no Angry Birds app. In fact, there is no keyboard/mouse or an elaborate LCD display for interacting with the device. Instead they must be connected to a trusted client — an ordinary computer that instructs the HSM over a minimalist interface tailored for cryptography — in order to generate new keys, perform specific operations using those keys and destroy said keys when they are no longer needed or desired.\n\nWith respect to Bitcoin companies, many offline “cold” vaulting systems (including Gemini’s) utilize HSMs in an “M-of-N” multi-signature security design whereby HSM transaction signers are held in separate, air-gapped, secure physical storage locations. No one particular HSM can spend funds on its own. Instead, a quorum of several HSMs are required to sign and thereby validate a given transaction with their private keys, effectively making the quorum of HSMs the manifestation of funds on deposit (i.e., money held in custody).\n\nCritical to this security design is that secret keys _never leave the HSM itself_; all operations take place within the secure execution environment of the HSM. For example, when decrypting a message, the ciphertext itself is sent to the device, where it is decrypted using the private keys held by (and inside of) the HSM and the decrypted message is returned back. This is distinct from a non-HSM device that actually reveals the private key to the attached trusted client to “borrow” for performing some operation. It is a fundamental design objective of HSMs to never reveal keys, not even to trusted clients when connected.\n\nAt Gemini, we have evaluated several different HSM models. One of the first vendors we reached out to was [Safenet](http://www.safenet-inc.com/ \"Safenet\"), recently acquired by the French conglomerate Gemalto. Safenet produces a [family of HSMs](http://www.safenet-inc.com/data-encryption/hardware-security-modules-hsms/), ranging from USB-attached compact Luna G5 to the network-connected SA7000, which is used by Amazon in its [CloudHSM](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/ \"CloudHSM\") offering where AWS customers can lease access to a device. While evaluating the Luna G5, **_we discovered a vulnerability that allows the extraction of secret keys_**_._ As it turns out, the problem is not unique to the G5; it applies to the entire family, including the PCIe version, as well as the networked appliance featured in CloudHSM.\n\nWhat makes this vulnerability somewhat unusual is that it is a consequence of _following a standard too closely_, as opposed to the more common problem of diverging from established practices. Safenet HSMs are closely based on the [PKCS#11 specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=pkcs11). This is a de facto standard designed to promote interoperability between cryptographic hardware by providing a consistent software interface. Imagine how difficult it would be to write a cryptographic application — such as a Bitcoin wallet — to work with external hardware if each device required a different API for signing a Bitcoin transaction. Certainly, the differences between devices are apparent: some connect over USB while others are addressed over TCP/IP. Each device typically requires a different device driver much like different brands of printers do. But once your HSM is connected, PKCS11 seeks to provide a higher-level point where these differences can be abstracted behind a unified API, with a vendor-provided PKCS#11 module translating the software concepts into the appropriate commands for that brand of hardware.\n\nPKCS #11 defines a series of “mechanisms” that a particular model of hardware can support. These include the usual suspects such as block ciphers (AES, 3DES, etc.) stream ciphers (RC4) keyed-MACs (HMAC, CBC-MAC), asymmetric encryption (RSA), key-agreement (Diffie-Hellman) and digital signatures (RSA again, ECDSA, etc.). PKCS #11, however, does not mandate that a particular mechanism be implemented by a given device, only a way to interrogate the device hardware to determine what is supported. Vendors can also define additional proprietary mechanisms as long as their identifiers do not conflict with the standard. It turns out that Safenet products implement a substantial amount of PKCS #11-defined mechanisms, and that is the problem. Not all of the ideas in PKCS #11 mechanisms are good. In particular, we found that several key derivation mechanisms create weak keys that can be brute-forced easily to recover the original key in a matter of seconds.\n\nSuccessful exploit requires authenticated access to the HSM, which can be done by subverting the legitimate trusted client that was using the HSM. That may sound like a prohibitive requirement or even tautological — “if your trusted client is compromised, then your cryptographic keys are also compromised.” But HSMs are specifically designed to _survive_ that threat model — the assumption goes that even if an adversary obtains temporary access to the secure physical storage location of the HSM, they can only perform limited operations with the stored key. They can not just ask the HSM to cough up a copy of its stored secrets. This type of vulnerability breaks that model: temporary access can be leveraged to fully exfiltrate both public and private keys and use them in the future, independent of the device.\n\nAs a matter of principle, we do not release weaponized exploits or proof-of-concept code that shows how to utilize a given bug. Instead we practice _responsible disclosure_ by working closely with vendors to help them find a solution to fix vulnerabilities, and then publish our findings after a patch is available to the public. We reported the vulnerability to Safenet on **January 30th, 2015**. It was confirmed by the vendor on **February 11th, 2015** and a security update for affected products has been released on **July 9th, 2015**. We plan to publish a follow-up post with additional technical details. For now it’s worth pointing out that the vulnerability affects all symmetric keys and some private-key types, including ECDSA keys used in Bitcoin. **_If you have been using Safenet HSMs for managing Bitcoin keys, your wallet may be at risk._**  Due to the nature of the vulnerability, it is not possible in all cases for customers to work-around the problem without applying the firmware update. In particular, having the HSM set to strict FIPS mode does not mitigate the risk. We encourage customers to upgrade to the latest version released by Safenet \\[[Bulletin](http://www.safenet-inc.com/technical-support/security-updates/)\\]. Users leasing an HSM via Amazon CloudHSM service should consult specific instructions provided by AWS.\n\nYou can find a more detailed description of this vulnerability [here](https://randomoracle.wordpress.com/2015/08/13/safenet-hsm-key-extraction-vulnerability-part-i/).\n\nCVD ID: [2015–5464](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5464)","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{}},{"id":"2heoSNGWcCAM4sI4HV8fki","blogIntroduction":"Today, my brother Tyler and I are proud to announce Gemini: a next generation bitcoin exchange.

What exactly do we mean by “next generation”? We mean a fully regulated, fully compliant, New York-based bitcoin exchange for both individuals and institutions alike. Why? Because it’s about time.\n\nBut before I go further, I’d like to take a moment to explain how we got here. Our interest in Bitcoin began in 2012. It was immediately obvious to us how awesome and powerful this technology was. People laughed, as they always do, when something is awesome, powerful and new, but that only helped to fuel our fire. Over the past two and a half years, we have spent a great deal of time educating ourselves and others about Bitcoin; investing in bitcoin; investing in Bitcoin-related companies; filing an S-1 registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to create the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (an ETF focused on bringing bitcoin investment exposure to main street investors) which will list on NASDAQ; and launching a bitcoin price index called WinkDex that will price our ETF ([online](http://winkdex.com/), [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/winkdex-bitcoin-price-index/id921018534?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mbai.winkdex)).\n\nWhen we began our ETF journey, we soon concluded that a US-regulated ETF wasn’t enough. A growing number of US investors, traders, financial institutions and businesses wanted to get involved with bitcoin directly, but had no options other than to trade overseas or sit on the sidelines. So, we began looking into exactly what it would take to create a US-based bitcoin exchange. During this time, and almost one year ago to the day, we testified at a public hearing at the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) regarding the development of virtual currencies and their promise. The two days of hearings were watched by close to 15 thousand people in 117 different countries, commonwealths and territories. Coming out of these hearings, it was clear to us that NYSDFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky and his staff understood the potential of this technology and were committed to building a regulatory framework that would both protect consumers and foster innovation in New York. It was also clear to us that Gemini had just found its home.\n\nSince last February, Tyler and I have been assembling the Gemini team. Our goal was simple: bring together the nation’s top security experts, technologists, and financial engineers to build a world-class exchange from the ground up with a security-first mentality. It’s true that Bitcoin’s promise is a new, frictionless money, but that all becomes academic if we don’t build towards an ecosystem that is free of hacking, fraud and security breaches. Today, our team is 14 strong (including me and Tyler), 11 of which are pure tech engineers. Our team spans both coasts and embodies decades of tier 1 work experience.\n\nWe are also thrilled to announce that we have secured a banking relationship with a New York State-chartered bank. This means that your money will never leave the country. It also means that US dollars on Gemini will be eligible for FDIC insurance and held by a US-regulated bank. Your US dollars on Gemini will be as safe and secure as they are in your bank account today.\n\nSo, why the name “Gemini”? After white-boarding a list of possible names for several weeks, we settled on Gemini for a host of reasons. Gemini is the Latin word for “twins” and as such, it inherently explores the concept of duality. We were drawn to this both because of the two worlds of money (old and new) that will intersect on the Gemini platform as well as the two-way nature of trade that it will facilitate. But that’s not all. Once we picked our name, a fun fact emerged. We realized that NASA’s Project Gemini was a spaceflight program focused on laying the groundwork for Apollo’s later mission to land man on the Moon. As such, it was coined (no pun intended) man’s “bridge to the moon.” In this spirit, we’ve built Gemini to be “your bridge to the future of money.” Oh, and Tyler and I just happen to be identical twin brothers.\n\nThe innovation of Bitcoin and widespread adoption of virtual currencies is not an if, but rather when. This was always going to happen.

Every couple of weeks, we’ll dig into some of the tokens available on Gemini and provide you with an overview of the projects and tokens we support on our platform. Today, we're exploring [Solana (SOL)](https://www.gemini.com/prices/solana).\n\nEarlier this week, [we announced support for Solana (SOL)](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-solana-sol), a burgeoning smart contract blockchain launched in 2020. Solana’s architecture is distinct from that of other smart contract platforms like Ethereum. For a deep dive into Solana, [check out this expert article on Cryptopedia](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/solana-blockchain) authored by Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana’s co-founder and CEO of Solana Labs. \n\n__Solana Basics__\n\n- __Native Token:__ [SOL](https://www.gemini.com/prices/solana)\n- __Consensus Mechanism:__ Proof of Stake\n- __Total Token Supply:__ Uncapped\n- __Transaction Speed:__ Over 50,000 transactions per second\n- [__Website__](https://solana.com/)\n- [__Whitepaper__](https://solana.com/solana-whitepaper.pdf)\n\n__SOL Token and Solana Use Cases__\n\n[SOL](https://www.gemini.com/prices/solana) is the native token of the [Solana network](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/solana-blockchain) and is used to pay for transactions on the network. Functioning as a [smart contract](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/crypto-smart-contracts-explained) platform, Solana aims to natively solve many of the scaling (growth) and throughput (volume) issues faced by other [layer-1 blockchain solutions](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-layer-2-network-layer-1-network). Solana’s primary focus is on scalability and the ability to support high-usage [decentralized applications (dApps)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Decentralized%20Application%20(dApp)). \n\nA variety of dApps have already been built on Solana, including [decentralized exchanges (DEXs)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-exchange-crypto-dex) like [Raydium](https://www.gemini.com/prices/raydium) and [Saber](https://www.gemini.com/prices/saber), mapping applications like Maps.me, and music streaming platforms like [Audius](https://www.gemini.com/prices/audius).\n\n__Technical Overview__\n\nThe network combines a [Proof-of-Stake (PoS)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/proof-of-stake-delegated-pos-dpos) consensus mechanism with what is known as [Proof of History (PoH)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Proof%20of%20History%20(PoH)), allowing validators to independently trust the time and order of transactions. \n\nSimilar to other blockchain networks like Bitcoin, validators on Solana earn rewards when they verify and process transactions. However, as a PoS blockchain, validators on Solana are chosen based on how much SOL they have staked on the network, rather than their computing power. Further, Solana is not an [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Ethereum%20Virtual%20Machine%20(EVM)) chain, and does not employ [sharding](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Sharding) to increase throughput. \n\nThe Solana network adds a further piece to its protocol puzzle: PoH. In simplified terms, PoH adds a “time” element to the cryptographic verifications on the Solana network using a verifiable delay function. [Read more about how PoS and PoH work together here](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/solana-blockchain#section-a-new-blockchain-architecture-proof-of-stake-and-proof-of-history). \n\nWe are excited about what the future holds for Solana and for the future of blockchain and crypto communities, and look forward to spotlighting other crypto projects as we continue on our mission to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini","inThisArticle":[],"pageMeta":{"metaTitle":"Token Spotlight: Learn About Solana and SOL on Gemini","metaDescription":"SOL is the native token of the Solana network and is used to pay for transactions on the network.

AcceleRaytor is operated by Raydium, and provides a platform for new Solana projects to distribute tokens. Raydium is a [decentralized exchange (DEX)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/decentralized-exchange-crypto-dex) frontend interface on the [Solana](https://www.gemini.com/prices/solana) network that plugs into the Serum DEX central limit order book. Raydium operates as an [automated market maker (AMM)](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/search?query=Automated%20Market%20Maker%20(AMM)) and acts as a traditional DEX on Ethereum (e.g. Uniswap, Sushiswap), while the trades themselves are executed through Serum. Raydium users can provide tokens to a [liquidity pool](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/what-is-a-liquidity-pool-crypto-market-liquidity) in a 1:1 ratio for a two-sided trading pair, and receive a portion of trading fees generated by the pool. Fees on Raydium are 0.25%, with 0.22% given to liquidity providers, and the remaining 0.03% allocated to stakers of RAY. Raydium also provides other avenues for earning yield through staking.

Saber functions similarly to the [Curve](https://www.gemini.com/prices/curve) protocol on [Ethereum](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/ethereum-blockchain-smart-contracts-dapps). The Saber DEX allows for low fee swaps of USD stablecoins. There are a number of Solana-based SPL tokens that have the same or similar assets backing them. For example, Solana supports USD Coin (USDC), Tether (USDT) and Terra (UST) that all target the price of USD1.00. The Saber DEX launched on June 1st, 2021 and launched its SBR token on July 15th, 2021.

We’ll also outline our [integration with TaxBit](https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-and-taxbit-partner-to-make-crypto-taxes-easier), which allows eligible Gemini users to create free accounts. \n\nBelow are five tips that can help you on your 2021 crypto taxes:\n\n1. __Who owes crypto taxes?__ All crypto assets earned by U.S. persons (U.S. citizens or residents) are taxable and required to be reported on a U.S. tax return regardless of whether you receive a tax form from Gemini (e.g. a Form 1099-MISC, which we will get into next). __NOTE:__ if your only activity was the purchase of crypto assets with fiat currency and you had no earnings or dispositions, you should not owe taxes on your crypto. \n2. __Who will receive a Form 1099-MISC from Gemini?__ Gemini issues Forms 1099-MISC for non-exempt U.S. exchange account holders who have earned more than USD 600 (or USD equivalent) in income during the relevant calendar year. You can download your Form 1099-MISC (or confirm you did not receive one) in the “Statements and History'' section on the “Account” page on the Gemini website or mobile app.\n3. __What kinds of crypto earnings are taxable?__ The IRS has issued guidance on the taxation of crypto activities including earnings, gains, losses, and donations. How these transactions are taxed may vary depending on your personal tax situation, which is why it is critical for each filer to consider their own situation independently. Crypto assets can also be earned on the Gemini exchange by lending assets through [Gemini Earn](https://www.gemini.com/earn), or through bonuses or promotions. \n4. __How to access your transaction history:__ When preparing your U.S. tax filing obligations, you may be required to reference your transaction data. You can access your transaction history by following these steps once you’re signed in to your account: 1) Navigate to https://exchange.gemini.com/history. 2) Click the “Transaction History” tab. 3) Click the download button and select your desired date range. Click \"Download.xlsx\" and the transaction history will download onto your device.\n5. __How to find IRS information about crypto taxes:__ We always recommend that you consult a tax advisor to determine your personal tax obligations, but if you want to do some research yourself on IRS regulations covering crypto, here are some resources: the [IRS’ FAQ on Virtual Currency Transactions](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions), and [IRS Publication 544](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p544.pdf) on how gains and losses from crypto dispositions may be taxed differently for different types of investors. \n\nAnother way that Gemini supports you on your crypto journey is through our partnership with crypto tax platform TaxBit. As a Gemini user, you may have access to a free TaxBit account, which could drastically simplify your crypto tax reporting process. \n\n[Create your free TaxBit account here.](https://taxbit.com/invite/gemini)\n\nTaxBit allows you to link your Gemini account — and any other TaxBit Network exchange account — to a central location, determine a tax lot selection method, and produce a Form 8949 that will determine your total gain or loss from crypto transactions to report on a Form 1040. \n\nFor more information about crypto taxes, [you can explore our FAQ](https://support.gemini.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000032643-What-Do-I-Need-To-Know-About-Cryptocurrency-Tax-Reporting-).\n\nWe are dedicated to providing you with the most seamless crypto experience possible, and equipping you with information to help you accurately report your crypto earnings is an important part of that process. We are thrilled to be on this journey with you as we continue on our mission to unlock the next era of financial, creative, and personal freedom.\n\nOnward and Upward!\n\nTeam Gemini\n\n*Disclaimer: The information above is provided for general informational purposes and should not be considered tax advice.
